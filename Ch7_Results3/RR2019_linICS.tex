\section{Experimental Setup}

This experiment was performed at the Astra Gemini facility in early 2019 using both laser arms of the dual laser beam facility.
A sketch of the relevant components of the setup are shown in Figure \ref{LinICS:Fig:SetupBlend}.

\subsubsection{Laser wakefield accelerator}

The driver beam for the wakefield accelerator is focused with an f/40 off-axis parabola (OAP) onto the edge of a 15 mm conical supersonic helium gas jet. The measured pulse duration was $61\,\mathrm{fs}$ \textsc{fwhm} with an average energy on-target of $12.5 \pm 0.2\,\mathrm{J}$, reaching a peak power of $195\,\mathrm{TW}$. The size of the focal spot measures $48.6 \times 39.2\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ \textsc{fwhm}, amounting to a peak normalised vector potential of $a_0 = 1.88$ in vacuum. The laser is polarised in the horizontal plane.
\vspace{\baselineskip}

The exit of the gas nozzle was positioned $14\,\mathrm{mm}$ below the beam axis. A steel razor blade is introduced $1.2\,\mathrm{mm}$ into the gas flow and $4\,\mathrm{mm}$ above the nozzle edge at $- 32.4\pm 0.3^\circ$ angle in vertical direction relative to the laser axis to produce a shock front. The electron density without the shock feature was $1.5 \times 10^{18}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, with an increase in density of XX times.

The gas target was characterised on-shot by a transverse optical probe, split from the main driver beam, used as shadowgraphy and coupled to a Mach-Zehnder interferometer to determine the density. 
The pathways are matched and a delay slide gives relative control over the timing.

The gas target and recombination light of the plasma channel are imaged by a Canon DSLR camera from the side and a CCD camera from the roof of the chamber.

\subsubsection{Scattering beam}

A second laser pulse is focused down tightly by an f/2 off-axis parabola (OAP) at the opposite edge of the gas jet in a geometry for head-on collisions. The f/2 OAP has a 21-mm-diameter hole in the centre to allow the electrons and radiation from ICS to propagate through. A round piece of plastic with radius $28\,\mathrm{mm}$ is also fitted around the hole to protect the optic from scattered light from the first laser. This reduces the on-target intensity by 16 degrees assuming a perfect top-hat laser profile. To protect the optic from potential debris a thin plastic layer with anti-reflective coating with a suitable hole (`pellicle') is attached to the OAP mount. The on-shot energy of the laser is $9.73\pm 0.15\,\mathrm{J}$ which reduces to $8.17\pm0.13\,\mathrm{J}$ with the hole. In the dataset presented, the beam size is defocused at about 400 micron size diameter, which translates into $a_0 \sim 0.28$ at the interaction. The laser is linearly polarised in the vertical plane.

\subsubsection{Two-beam timing}

Both beams are timed to each other using spatial interferometry. A 90-degree dielectric knife-edge prism (Thorlabs) was inserted at the interaction point, deflecting both beams collinearly onto the CCD chip of a camera. Due to the different radii of curvature of both beams near the focus of the f/2 beam, a circular interference pattern emerges when the beams are overlapped in space and time. The timing procedure is explained in more details in the \nameref{Chap:Methods}.

\subsubsection{Particle and Radiation diagnostics}

The radiation and the electrons propagate through the hole in the f/2 OAP into a large aperture ($\sim 10\,\mathrm{cm} \times 60\,\mathrm{cm}$) permanent dipole magnet\footnote{designed by Dominik Hollatz (Jena)} of integrated magnet field $\int B(x) \mathrm{d}x = 0.35\,\mathrm{Tm}$. A linear translation stage carrying high-Z metal converter targets (bismuth, tungsten) can be driven into the beam path to intercept the electron beam and to produce gamma radiation from bremsstrahlung to calibrate the gamma-ray diagnostics in this experiment. As alternative a low-Z PTFE target of thickness $1.6$ mm is mounted on the same stage to allow synchronous electron and gamma-ray measurements.

The electrons are dispersed spectrally in the horizontal plane and leave the vacuum chamber through a two-layer wide-aperture vacuum window\footnote{designed and tested by Mechanical Engineering CLF, in particular Daniel Treverrow.} of dimensions $580 \,\mathrm{mm} \times 70\,\mathrm{mm}$. The first layer facing the vacuum is $25\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ of Kapton followed by $375\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ of Kevlar to provide additional mechanical stability and fibre support that holds as fail-safe.
A scintillating Lanex screen placed just after the window measures the spectrum of the dispersed electron beam. Due to the light material of the window and the short distance from the window to the screen, the electron beam is only little affected by small-angle scattering. The screen is at $1.61\,\mathrm{m}$ distance downstream of the interaction point. A second Lanex screen measures the spectrum $700\,\mathrm{mm}$ further downstream ($2.31\,\mathrm{m}$ from the interaction point) and can in conjunction with the first screen be used to account for a pointing of the beam (REF).
The electron spectrum is cut off at $220$ MeV due to the limiting aperture of the magnet as lower energetic electrons collide with the yoke from the inside and do not leave the magnet.
Both screens are imaged by cooled 16-bit CCD cameras (Andor Neo) equipped with objectives and bandpass filters. A third camera images a small region of interest on the first screen.
\vspace{\baselineskip}

Radiation traverses the magnet on the laser axis, then passes through a $120\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ aluminium laser beam block and the Kevlar-Kapton window. Bright radiation in the right bandwidth is also captured by the first Lanex screen as it extends beyond the axis. A $45 \times 45$ array of $1\,\mathrm{mm} \times 1\,\mathrm{mm} \times 10 \,\mathrm{mm}$ scintillating caesium-iodide (CsI) crystals coated in $TiO_2$  measures the profile of the radiation at the plane of the second Lanex screen, which is placed $700\,\mathrm{mm}$ downstream from the first screen. The stack covers a field of view corresponding to cone with half angle $11.7\,\mathrm{mrad}$. Including the coating the spatial resolution is then $1.2\,\mathrm{mm}/2.31\,\mathrm{m} = 0.52\,\mathrm{mrad}$. A scintillation signal produced by radiation on the first Lanex screen and the CsI profile screen can be used as on-shot reference for the laser axis for the electron spectrometer screens. Another $704\,\mathrm{mm}$ further downstream another elongated array of CsI crystals is positioned to measure the spectrum of the gamma radiation. Both stacks, the profile screen and the spectrometer, are imaged using cooled 14-bit EMCCD cameras (Andor iXons). Both diagnostics are described in more detail in the Methods section along with how their response is simulated in the Monte-Carlo code GEANT4.

\iffalse
The aperture of the magnet permits a field-of-view of $79\,\mathrm{mrad}$ (10cm/1.26m) and is hence less limiting than the OAP hole. On the laser axis a beam block of $10-12$ layers of standard kitchen aluminium foil of thickness $10.1 \pm 0.2 \,\mathrm{\mu m}$ each is attached to the Kevlar-Kapton window. Hard X-rays continue to propagate through the aluminium beam block and the vacuum window (permitting a FOV of $70/1.61 = 43.4 mrad$ , the LANEX screen that also covers the axis and are then after $700\,\mathrm{mm}$ incident on a $45 \times 45$ array of $1\,\mathrm{mm} \times 1\,\mathrm{mm} \times 10 \,\mathrm{mm}$ scintillating caesium-iodide crystals coated in $TiO_2$ that record the beam profile of the radiation burst. The top part of the stack is centred on the beam axis. The total stack covers $54.2/2.31 = 23.4\,\mathrm{mrad}$. A second $30 \times 30$ stack of  $1.5\,\mathrm{mm} \times 1.5\,\mathrm{mm} \times 10 \,\mathrm{mm}$ CsI crystals is placed on top of the other one, covering another $51.2\,\mathrm{mm}$ or $22.2\,\mathrm{mrad}$. Harder radiation propagates another $704\,\mathrm{mm}$ before hitting another array of caesium-idodide crystals (see Methods for dual axis spectrometer) with an aluminium front-plate that are arranged in longitudinal direction to measure the spectrum of the radiation. The front part of the spectrometer then catches $XX/3m$ FOV. The emission of the caesium-iodide crystals is imaged by Andor iXon cameras.

\section{Characterisation of Electron Spectra}

The electron spectra measured in this experiment were produced by producing a shock in the supersonic gas flow. To characterise the electron beams we will rely only on the first electron spectrometer screen and ignore potential fluctuations in the energy due to pointing variations. The image processing of the data is not further elaborated here but can be found in XX THESIS JASON KRIS XX METHODS.

In the dataset considered in this Chapter the properties of the electron beam vary strongly from shot-to-shot and produce beams of a wide range of shapes, maximum energy and energy spread. A few examples of electron spectra from the relevant dataset are provided in Figure \ref{linICS:Figs:Elec_example}.

The properties and the irregularity of the results at one fixed blade (and shock) position is not consistent with results from other laser systems where shock injection was used to produce reproducible electron beams with narrow energy spread. This will not be resolved as part of this Chapter and is beyond the scope of this thesis, but will be addressed in a separate publication (PENDING MATT?).
\vspace{\baselineskip}

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[trim={4.8cm 0 5cm 0}, clip, width=1.0\columnwidth]{Example_Espec_CollisionMontage.png}
\caption{Example Especs, not in shooting order.}
\label{linICS:Figs:Elec_example}
\end{figure}

In some cases the electron beam shows signatures of strong vertical oscillations which indicate potential to act as a bright betatron source. In other cases beams with narrow energy spread at 1 GeV are produced. 

Over the course of a 499 shot dataset the maximum energy of the electron beam is about $923\pm206\,\mathrm{MeV}$ with some beams reaching up to 1.3 GeV. 
\EliasComm{Make a histogram maximum energy.}
\EliasComm{Make histogram vertical pointing.}
\EliasComm{make histogram energy spread.}
\EliasComm{Make histogram divergence?}
\EliasComm{Make histogram charge?}

The charge of the beam varies in particular due to the varying length of the bunch (spectrally) at $199 \pm 102\,\mathrm{pC}$.

The divergence of the beam is $2.4\pm 1.4\,\mathrm{mrad}$.

Since the electron beams vary strongly in their character, the radiation they produce in an interaction will also vary.
In order to study their behaviour more systematically we will categorise the electron beams based on the spectral length of the bunches and their energy. We can then investigate the radiation produced by comparable electron beams and try to understand the scattering process, without the overlaying strong variations of the beam parameters.


\section{Gamma spectra from linear inverse Compton scattering}

\subsection{Estimating Spectrum}

The normalised vector potential is:

\begin{equation}
a_0 \approx 0.85 \lambda [\mu m] \sqrt{I [10^{18} cm^{-2}]}
\end{equation}

The electron beams shown above were collided with at an intensity of $a_0 < 0.3$, which is sufficiently below 1 such that we can justify describing this interaction via purely linear ICS. We can estimate the emitted radiation to be described by the following equation:

\begin{equation}
E_{ph}' = E_{ph}\frac{2(1+\beta\cos \theta)\gamma^2}{1+a^2_0/2 + \gamma^2 \theta^2_0} = \frac{4\gamma^2}{1+a^2_0/2 + \gamma^2 \theta^2_0}
\end{equation}

For a $4\,\mathrm{mrad}$ beam the difference through the electron angles for a collimated light source is less than 0.001 percent, so we can ignore this effect.

For a f/2 beam the range of angles is up to 14.04 degrees but since we are interacting with a small subset of the beam (few microns of 400, the angle should be taken as constant but it could vary by up to 3 percent, which again is not a large change and we will again neglect this factor.

The Rayleigh length for f/2 beam is $2.5 \lambda f^2_\#$, so 8um.
To reach 400um, we have to propagate the beam by 800um from the focal plane. This is of order 100 $z_R$ and we can assume that we are in the near field of the laser and that we have a homogeneous flat top profile we interact with.

Linear ICS in a head-on collision scenario predicts that photons will be emitted in a narrow 1/gamma cone ($\gamma = 1750$ for 900 MeV, so 0.6 mrad).
For a head-on collision, $a_0 << 1$ and small observation angles this simplifies then to

\begin{equation}
E_{ph}' =4\gamma^2 E_{ph}.
\end{equation}

This also does not perturb the electron beam since

\begin{equation}
\psi = \gamma^2 a_0 \frac{2 r_e \omega}{3c} << 1.
\end{equation}

For a Ti:Sa system at 1.55 eV central photon energy this converts XX into XX, see Figure XX.
\EliasComm{Make plot of Ephoton against electron energy to indicate range of energies achievable.}


\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[trim={4.8cm 0 5cm 0}, clip, width=1.0\columnwidth]{Example_Espec_CollisionICSMontage.png}
\caption{Example Espec to ICS radiation. Maybe replace this with one main plot and different X-axis (one for electron energy, second for photon energy, plot second harmonic in red/other colour matching second x-axis.}
\end{figure}

For the first harmonic this gives in some cases narrow-energy radiation of 35 MeV with 4 MeV.
In other case this gives broadband radiation of few to 20 MeV radiation which is of interest for industrial applications.


For future experiments, this setup is in principle able to produce high-intensity interactions.


\subsection{Fitting data}


... show the profile screen and gamma spec raw data


To measure the spectrum a CsI stack was used. The simulation of the detector response and the experimental calibration was done as described in Methods XX. In this case the spectral fitting is performed by assuming a 1-to-1 mapping of the spectra. As a comparison a mono-energetic photon is used to see a similar response.

... use the linear spectra for the examples to fit to the response

... show that mono-energetic is also a good fit, so the response is dominated by the highest counts of photons, so without knowing the input is difficult

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\columnwidth]{linICS_GSpec_FittingEx1}\includegraphics[width=0.5\columnwidth]{linICS_GSpec_FittingEx1}
\caption{Show two fitting examples and electron spectra, along with mono spectral fit.}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Nonlinearity}


For this purpose, now for a range of $a_0$ show what the impact of nonlinearity would be in terms of broadening, redshift, harmonic.
Show an example of linear with weakly and moderately non-linear (based on redshift and harmonics)
... try to perturb with nonlinearity and see whether it finds better, give estimate of $a_0$ (not good)
.. try to see when it would start to become visible and estimate an intensity (this could be used as intensity estimate, which it will be used for in the other section).

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1.0\columnwidth]{PlaceHolder_perturbedResponse.png}
\caption{This is to indicate change in response.}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Limits}

... in this energy range a converter gamma spectrometer would work very well (depending on the converter Li or so?)



\section{Gamma yield from scattering}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[trim={4.8cm 0 5cm 0}, clip, width=0.5\columnwidth]{Egamma_ICS.png}\includegraphics[trim={4.8cm 0 5cm 0}, clip, width=0.5\columnwidth]{Edep_Jena_1_100_MeV.png}
\caption{Left: Radiation produced in head-on ICS collision for different electron energies. Right: Energy deposition per photon in stack.}
\end{figure}

In the previous section we confirmed that the spectra are within some bound one-to-one mappings of the electron spectrum.

Estimate the number of photons produced in an interactions (REF Felicie and Alec's paper)

\begin{equation}
N_X = \frac{\sigma}{\pi w^2_0} N_L N_e,
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_T = 6.65 \times 10^{-25}\,\mathrm{m}^{-2}$ the Thomson scattering cross-section. Since we are in the near-field of the laser the size of the electron beam is not important as we can assume a homogeneous photon density for each electron.

Estimate $N_L$. For average $a_0 \sim 0.3$ and photon energy $1.55\,\mathrm{eV}$, intensity XX, we get N photons per micron squared.
So X number of photons for a 100 pC beam?

Ignore temporal structure as focusing effects are negligible and we just assume a constant field.

\begin{equation}
N_X = \frac{\sigma}{\pi w^2_0} \left[\frac{E}{E_{ph}} \frac{\pi w^2_0}{\pi r^2}\right] \left[\frac{Q}{e}\right]
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
N_X = \frac{\sigma}{\pi r^2} \frac{E}{E_{ph}}
\end{equation}

So in useful units

\begin{equation}
N_X = 5.32 \times 10^{10} E [J] Q [100pC] r[\mu m]^{-2}
\end{equation}

For 10 Joules, 100 pC and 200 um radius we then get $1.33 \times 10^{7}$ photons which is of similar order as betatron sources (Chen and Kneip), but reaching 1000-times higher energies. The source size is determined by the size of the electron beam at the interaction (anywhere between few microns to where they are). HAVE TO CHECK BUT IS THE SOURCE SIZE MAYBE NOT IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE ARE USING THE VIRTUAL ELECTRON SOURCE? DOES THAT MEAN WE CAN LET THE BEAM EXPAND IF OUR BEAM IS INTENSE ENOUGH AND GUARANTEE OVERLAP EASILY?

For the parameters above we get $2.6 \pm 1.4 \times 10^{7}$ photons above 1 MeV for electrons above 220 MeV.

The average maximum energy is $923 \pm 206$ which translates at head-on collision into a peak gamma radiation of $20 \pm 10\,\mathrm{MeV}$.


... propose equation for total yield

... use that for the successful collisions and see whether it fits the trend

We have a relationship for energy of the radiation times energy deposition in the gamma profile from GEANT

How much does this change in terms of energy deposition per electron or charge over 100 MeV or so?
What is the `contrast' of this method?

So we expect the energy deposition to be 

\begin{equation}
E_{dep} (\gamma) N_X = \int E_{dep} (\gamma) \frac{\sigma}{\pi \omega^2_0} N_L \frac{\mathrm{d}N_e}{\mathrm{d}\gamma}\mathrm{d}\gamma,
\end{equation}

Check if that aligns with results in terms of trends.

Check if the absolute calibration is of any use to estimate the numbers.

PROPOSE HOW MUCH SMALLER WE COULD GO IN TERMS OF ENERGY AND SPOT SIZE AND WHAT KIND OF LASER COULD BE USE NOT TO SCAN BUT TO DO SINGLE-SHOT MEASUREMENTS.

MAYBE USE LONG FOCUSING OR THAT REDUCES ACCURACY IN TERMS OF FOCAL POINT.


\section{ICS as electron beam diagnostic}

\subsection{Resolving spatial features}

WOULD HAVE TO SCAN TO GET THE SPATIAL COMPONENT TO THEN GET EMITTANCE.

Since it does not perturb the electron beam and only interacts with some electrons due to the low photon density, ICS has been used previously as beam diagnostic as laser wire in recognition of a physical wire.
Due to the Lorentz boost radiation in ICS is emitted in a narrow forward cone and is hence dominated by the bunch itself. This means a head-on collision is acting similarly to an electron profile screen and represents a longitudinal integration of the transverse shape. In contrast to a profile lanex screen this does not scatter the beam (or only a small fraction). This could be used as pointing reference whenever the beam is expanded and an overlap is guaranteed.


\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[trim={4.8cm 0 5cm 0}, clip, width=1.0\columnwidth]{linICS_LaserWire_Examples_2.png}
\caption{Laser Wire example Espec and Gamma Profile for off-axis charge.}
\end{figure}

For lower energy spread we can ignore change in response of the detector to higher energies.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[trim={4.8cm 0 5cm 0}, clip, width=0.8\columnwidth]{linICS_example_MatchingIntensities.png}
\caption{Intensity check.}
\end{figure}

We see that a beam with large oscillations shows up as elongated profile which implies that it does not oscillate much in the other direction.

We see that a slightly bent beam shows up as tilted ellipse which indicates that the kink in the beam is in two dimensions.

These examples show that it can reveal, given enough energy and homogeneous illumination and spatial resolution, some information about the properties of the electron beam beyond the dispersion axis without perturbation.


... estimate what kind of intensity we would require if used the beam more economically.

\subsubsection{Matching up features}

Trying to match up intensities. Assume that the divergences have to match up (scale x-axis accordingly and y-axis).

Using something with two features. Seeing that this does not seem to line up, there is a brighter side-lobe for some reason, also more distinct. This must be due to the crystal structure, even Gaussian filter makes this more distinct. Can average this out. Maybe variation in intensity. Using this example as the energies are all comparable. Increase in intensity by 50 percent, which would still mean $a_0 < 0.4$. This would realistically only be possible if the electron beam is expanded such that it can see variations in intensity.

\EliasComm{Intensity profile?}


\subsection{2D divergence measurements}

By comparing the divergence from the screen and the gamma profile (assuming laser parameter, can we say something?)

... profile tells us about spatial things and also a bit energy due to yield


\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1.0\columnwidth]{linICS_FWHM_Y_Espec_GP_2.png}
\caption{Clear correlation of FWHM.}
\end{figure}

The divergences of the gamma rays and the electrons are strongly related.
We expect them to linearly relate to each other. We integrate over the entire beam, so different parts will contribute differently, but for now let us assume overall the beam energies are roughly of the same order of magnitude.

\begin{equation}
\theta_f = \theta_e + 1/(\gamma N^{1/2}_0)
\end{equation}
with laser oscillations $N_0 = 10$.

This means changing the energy from 500 MeV to 1000 MeV would change the divergence from 0.32 to 0.16 mrad, so this is a small factor especially given the spatial resolution is of order 0.52 mrad. So in general this should correlate.

Seeing Figure XX we see that the FWHM values in the non-dispersion direction correlate well at a slope of 1 (ERROR). This means that the spatial calibration is good and the two match up as expected. The y-axis value is 1.4 mrad. The values are scattered around the fit parameter which could be a combination of change in energy (ESTIMATE ERRORS 0.2 mrad), FWHM fit error XX, and limited spatial resolution. The standard deviation from the fit is 0.81 mrad which is just around what the spatial resolution and the change of energy would provide.

The additional 1.4 mrad require 250 MeV and times 2, which is not the case in all situations, so not sure where this is coming from.
\vspace{\baselineskip}

Independently of the origin, we can use this to estimate the electron divergence from this fit, and solving the previous equation:

\begin{equation}
\theta_e = \theta_\gamma - C
\end{equation}

For the same dataset this gives us an electron divergence of $2.2 \pm 1.4\,\mathrm{mrad}$ in the dispersion direction. In comparison it is $2.2 \pm 0.6\,\mathrm{mrad}$ in the other axis, which is very similar. 

This induces an error bar on the energy measurement, but on average the assumption that the divergence is symmetric would be close.

There are also examples where the electron beam has a high ellipticity and one could either over- or underestimate the properties.

By dividing the electron beam divergences, the calculated and the measured quantity, we obtain a value for the ellipticity.
It is $1.05\pm 0.7$. Add a histogram for this. Which means that on average the value is 1 but there are oscillations.


This is also of interest as we know from PUBLICATION A0 (WITH OR WITHOUT TOM BLACKBURN) that we can infer a0 from the ellipticity of the gamma signal. If we can properly characterise the fluctuations in the pointing and ellipticity, we can also be reassured about which portion is due to source size and which is due to intensity.


\subsection{Beam Pointing}

In addition, this is more reliably telling us the pointing than betatron radiation. We can use this to characterise the beam.

\EliasComm{Pointing correlated?}

\EliasComm{Pointing of beams related?}

On one hand this can be used as on-shot pointing reference if the lanex is placed in the same plane or it can be correlated, to know where the beam axis is.

\section{Conclusion}
