\section{Summary of Results}
\label{Chap:Conclusion}
The experimental results presented in this Thesis demonstrated the capability of laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA) to produce highly energetic radiation from few to hundreds of MeV photon energies, and their application in the context of fundamental studies of quantum electrodynamics (QED):

\begin{itemize}
\item In Chapter \ref{Chap:linICS}, relativistic electron beams with energies up to $1.3\,\mathrm{GeV}$ were collided with laser pulses at $a_0 \sim 0.3$, producing over 100s of shots radiation from linear inverse Compton scattering of variable spectral shape in the range of 10s of MeV photon energies. 
A procedure to align and overlap the laser pulse and electron beam and maintain the alignment over extended periods of time was developed. Linear inverse Compton scattering was also considered as non-invasive electron beam diagnostics.

\item In Chapter \ref{Chap:RR15}, relativistic electron beams of energy $\epsilon \approx 550\,\mathrm{MeV}$ were collided with a highly intense laser pulse of intensity $a_0 \approx 10$, producing broadband synchrotron-like radiation with a critical energy $\epsilon_{crit} > 35\,\mathrm{MeV}$ from non-linear inverse Compton scattering. The high energy of the emitted photons lead to a measurable energy loss in the electron spectra due to radiation reaction.


\item In Chapter \ref{Chap:BW}, electron beams were propagated through a bismuth target to produce a highly-energetic gamma-ray beam from bremsstrahlung. The yield, collimation and noise of the bremsstrahlung source were optimised for its application in a photon-photon collider experiment with the aim to produce electron-positron pairs from the linear Breit-Wheeler process. The second photon source was a keV X-ray source from a burn-through foil heated by a high-intensity laser. The variations in performance of both high-energy photon sources and the implications for measuring Breit-Wheeler pairs in this and future experiments were discussed.

\subsection{Outlook: Experimental Setup for Future Radiation Reaction Measurements using LWFA}


\subsection{Motivation}


\subsubsection{Achieved so far - Summary}


\begin{itemize}
\item managed to get some measurements of radiation reaction but low confidence
\item would want to make precision measurement to distinguish the models, using other observables
\item want to interact at even higher intensities to produce pairs
\end{itemize}

What we have done so far
\begin{itemize}
\item shown we can overlap beams in space and time
\item shown overlap over 100s of shots at low intensity
\item shown that this can be used as beam diagnostics
\item have a technique to go from there to high-intensity collisions
\item shown we were able to perform high-intensity collisions
\item were able to determine statistical confidence by measuring the gamma-ray spectrum and the electron spectrum simultaneously radiation reaction
\item identified parameters which are most suitable for high-precision studies 
\end{itemize}



Range of phenomena and measurements to do

Can identify interesting regimes  \cite{Arran2019_RR_PPCF,Arran2019_RR_SPIE}.



\subsubsection{Where to go from here}


We might be able to reach a regime where QED effects become relevant as the `quantumness' parameter $\eta$, indicating how much the interaction is dominated by QED effects \cite{Bell2008_PairsEta,Blackburn2014_QRR}, approaches values close to $1$. In this regime we expect gamma rays to be produced early in the interaction that can then combine with the copious amounts of laser photons available to produce electron-positron pairs \cite{Blackburn2017_pairs}. At the same time, this work in conjunction with \cite{Arran2019_RR_PPCF,Arran2019_RR_SPIE} indicates that by improving the electron beam quality differences in models can be measured even at comparable laser and electron energies, giving future experiments at Gemini or comparable laser facilities the opportunity to bridge the gap between these first measurements of radiation reaction and the future projects being worked on at the next generation experiments.

\textbf{Structure for motivation}
\begin{itemize}
\item what kind of interesting phenomena are there when increasing energy and intensity?
\item what kind of diagnostics and measurements would that require (which then leads over to the sections)?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Laser Wakefield Accelerator}


\begin{itemize}
\item Focusing geometry: long focusing $f/40$ or longer
\item give example of maximum energy, show low energy spread is possible
\item Targetry and injection: gas jet (diagnostics access and damaging properties, stability can be improved, less important at high intensities, narrow-energy spread beams through shock injection, could fix timing with shock injection
\end{itemize}



The gas target would be a gas jet, as concluded in Chapter \ref{Chap:RR15}, as it allows debris-free high-intensity interaction and open access for diagnostics, which is more favourable than the potential increases shot-to-shot stability of a gas cell target as used in Chapter \ref{Chap:BW}. It has been shown in Chapter \ref{Chap:linICS} that we can shoot suitably high above the nozzle ($up to 14\,\mathrm{mm}$) to avoid damage to the nozzle, whilst still encountering a sufficient density profile and still produce suitable electron beams.

Introducing a shock front on purpose in Chapter \ref{Chap:linICS} produced comparable electron beams to beams measured in \ref{Chap:RR15}. In Chapter \ref{Chap:RR15} the beams exhibited a distinct spectral feature at 550 MeV. This was reproduced in Chapter \ref{Chap:linICS}, but reaching higher energies up to 1.3 GeV. The beams were of high charge and electrons were measured consistently over 100s of shots. In some cases, shock injection also showed the potential to produce high-charge narrow-energy-spread beams at the 1 GeV level at few percent energy spread. The reproducibility of these beams has to be improved and is ongoing research. However, the potential for these beams is favourable especially to distinguish models.
A shock injected beam is also expected to have a fixed injection point and hence constant relative timing to the driver beam at the interaction.

We hope to explore whether we can increase the final energy of the electron beam whilst maintaining the low energy spread by increasing the length of the gas jet and increasing the driver beam energy. 
\vspace{\baselineskip}



Low energy spread beams (shock injection, but also \cite{Wang2013_GEV_FIUDICIAL} and see Chapter \ref{Chap:linICS})




We are able to produce a high-charge electron beam with the potential to be a narrow-energy spread beam (shock injection, Chapter \ref{Chap:linICS}) with fixed injection point.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Short focal length}


As fielded successfully in Chapters \ref{Chap:linICS} and \ref{Chap:RR15}, we propose the use of an f/2 OAP which allows tight focusing to a spot of similar dimensions as the electron beam at the exit of the accelerator. 

\subsubsection{Beam geometry}

\begin{itemize}
\item $\eta$ maximised in head-on collision
\item energy loss if with hole
\item wave front error with hole
\item ease of alignment and long temporal overlap in head-on
\item supercritical if off-axis
\item depending on cascading or high peak $\eta$ we might want to use different geometries
\item large divergence radiation is against hole but also requires wider off-axis angle
\item see Figure 
\item off-axis might reusable dumped beam using parabola?
\item if super large optics for future generations of laser then the small hole is minimal
\end{itemize}

\begin{equation}
\eta = \frac{(1-\cos \theta) \gamma E_L}{E_S} \propto (1-\cos\theta) \sqrt{I_L}

\subsection{Electron beam diagnostics}

Fiudicials & Reference & Wires & Scatter, block, noise & \cmark/\xmark
\end{tabular}
\caption[Overview of electron beam diagnostics.]{Overview of electron beam diagnostics.}
\end{table}


\begin{itemize}
\item electron beam measurement
\item ICS for profile measurement, ellipticity, etc.
\item double screen spectrometer, fiudicials
\item polarisation measurement with ICS?
\item high resolution/different dynamic range/high mag
\item overlap radiation and energy axis for calibration and energy reference
\item statistical analysis
\item absolute calibration, in a permanent setup ideally
\end{itemize}

The electron energy will be measured as previously using a magnetic spectrometer setup. As in Chapter \ref{Chap:linICS} this can be done just outside the vacuum window which allows easy access to the screen for absolute calibration and imaging.

A thin window (kevlar kapton) as used in Chapter \ref{Chap:linICS} helps to reduce the scattering and producing secondaries. 

Since we have seen in Chapter \ref{Chap:linICS} that the electron beam underlies significant jitter in pointing and the an accurate knowledge of the energy is important for the measurement, we propose to install a second Lanex screen to account for global pointing fluctuations \cite{Soloviev2011_TWOSCREEN}, as done in Chapter \ref{Chap:linICS} but not explicitly used in the analysis so far. We also consider using fiudicials as spatial references \cite{Wang2013_GEV_FIUDICIAL}, but the available drift distances, scattering in screens and additional noise are reasons against this. Since we are also interested in measuring changes in energy spread, we propose a separate camera imaging a region of interest at high resolution. This was done in Chapter \ref{Chap:linICS}, but due to insufficient filtering the images were saturated.

\subsection{Radiation diagnostics}

\subsubsection{Gamma Profile}

 \cite{HarShemesh2012_INTENSITY,Yan2017_ICS}
Blackburn \addref{}

\begin{itemize}
\item scintillating screen
\item spatial diagnostic
\item intensity diagnostic
\item calculate field of view required for $a_0 = 25$ interactions
\item spatial resolution required?
\end{itemize}


Estimate required spatial dimensions of the gamma profile screen as follow:

\begin{itemize}
\item the radiation emitted is $\theta \sim a_0/\gamma$ for a half angle or variance $\sigma = a_0/4\gamma$
\item this adding up with an initial electron beam divergence of $theta_e$
\item and a typical beam pointing fluctuation of $\sigma_e$
\item assume the extreme case of $a_0 = 25$ and $1$ GeV
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Gamma Spectrometer}


\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{GmmaDets_DoubleScreen.png}
\caption{Gamma detectors as proposed for a future campaign. Gamma profile and (dual-axis) gamma spectrometer as used before to measure profile and intensity. A new, not yet fielded, addition would be the converter spectrometer separating produced pairs and Compton electrons using a magnet and measuring these to increase the sensitivity of the spectrometer setup.}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item gamma spectrometer to estimate spectrum
\item dual-axis could be useful
\item want to improve resolution, so maybe combine with converter
\item has to be balanced with gamma profile position, calculate dispersion needed, noise from aperture and so on
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{X-ray Crystal Spectrometer}

In Chapter \ref{Chap:BW}, we used a crystal spectrometer setup in vacuum to measure radiation at around 1.5 keV produced from a burn-through foil heated by a laser. In the context of radiation reaction, lower energy X-rays are also of interest and the capability to measure those is of advantage. Derivations in the locally constant field approximation (LCFA) \cite{Ritus1985_QRR} and models beyond deviate in particular at lower energies \cite{DiPiazza2018_LCFA}. In LCFA low energy X-rays are emitted at larger divergences, so measuring low energy X-rays at high divergences is a suitable test of the approximation. Including a polarisation dependence will help distinguishing signal. Due to the low energy it is necessary to measure the X-rays in vacuum, but at the same time we have to stay clear of the laser axis to avoid laser damage and to interfere with the electron beam and the gamma radiation.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{LCFACam_CloseUp.png}
\caption{Measuring divergent X-ray components with a crystal spectrometer setup as used in Chapter \ref{Chap:BW}. A measurement of this radiation can help to investigate the validity of the locally constant field approximation (LCFA) in these interactions. The positioning of the crystal is challenging as it has to stay clear of the electron, positron and main gamma beam, and also needs to be protected from laser damage.}

\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item motivation LCFA
\item angular distribution, calculate feasibility based on laser and gamma-ray divergence
\item polarisation dependence
\item what kind of angle or crystal would we require?
\item shielding or signal-to-noise?
\item inside chamber?
\item is radiation polarisation dependent, i.e. is the crystal orientation important?
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Single Particle Diagnostics}

In high-intensity interactions with sufficiently energetic electrons the gamma rays produced in nonlinear ICS can merge with multiple laser photons to produce pairs from nonlinear BW and other pair production processes. The pairs are produced, similarly as in Chapter \ref{Chap:BW} in the direction of the electron beam, and due to the low number of particles (ESTIMATE) we require a detector that is able to measure down to the single particle level. In Chapter \ref{Chap:BW} we presented such a setup. A magnetic chicane is separating the right energy band of particles. Shielding reduces the noise from stray particles onto the detectors and allow sensitivity to single particle level. Large aperture magnets help reducing the chance of producing pairs from scattered radiation and particles close to the axis, which then make it to the detector plane through the chicanes. We have to investigate if an on-axis f/2 holey parabola makes any sense or will produce too much noise (FOVs). Tracking layers help to discriminate against noise and identify particle species. For this we used silicon-based, fast TimePix3 detectors. Absolute calibration of single particle detectors enables identification of correct particles. This has been shown in Chapter \ref{Chap:BW}.
The magnets were also tested for electron beams using an identical set of magnets, so the fields are nicely mapped.
We have also shown that we can use the Bethe-Heitler process to calibrate our chicane system, by inserting a high-Z material in the path of gamma-rays to calibrate the effective yield we can measure (tungsten blob).

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{MagneticChicane.png}
\caption{Sketch of the beam transport for electrons and positrons consisting of two permanent large aperture dipole magnets as used in Chapter \ref{Chap:BW}. Electrons and positrons are dispersed horizontally. The positrons are redirected onto a set of single particle detectors by a second dipole magnet.}
\end{figure}




We fielded a magnetic chicane to isolate positrons in Chapter \ref{Chap:BW} and tracked particles for noise discrimination using TimePix3 detectors and measured particles on a single-particle counting CsI array. This shows us the shielding and detector capabilities enable us to measure single particles produced in an event and that we are able to distinguish those from noise. This would be of interest in a very intense interaction where in a second step non-linear BW. This gives us a threshold for intensity.
We were able to calibrate these diagnostics by converting gamma radiation into pairs by inserting converter materials in the beam path.
