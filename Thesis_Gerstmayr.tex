\chapter*{Abstract}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Abstract}  

The driving theme of this thesis is the experimental production and characterisation of high-energy gamma radiation using a laser wakefield accelerator (LWFA), and its application in the context of studies of fundamental QED phenomena.
\vspace{\baselineskip}

An electron beam from shock injection of an energy up to $1.3\,\mathrm{GeV}$ was collided with a laser pulse at an intensity of $a_0 \sim 0.2 - 1$ producing 10's of MeV photons from linear inverse Compton scattering (ICS). The emitted radiation was used to diagnose the properties of the electron beam and of the laser pulse at the interaction. It was demonstrated that this can also be used to systematically facilitate the spatio-temporal overlap of the electron beam and the laser pulse in future radiation reaction studies.
\vspace{\baselineskip}

A relativistic electron beam of energy $\epsilon > 500\,\mathrm{MeV}$ was collided with a tightly focused laser pulse with $a_0 \sim 10$. The interaction generated broadband synchrotron-like radiation from non-linear inverse Compton scattering (ICS) with critical energies $\epsilon_{crit} > 30\,\mathrm{MeV}$, which are the highest ICS photon energies reported from an all-optical setup at this time. The high photon energies in turn enabled a significant measurement of energy loss in the electron beam, rendering this the first published measurement of radiation reaction in an LWFA setup.
\vspace{\baselineskip}

An electron beam from LWFA was used to commission a bremsstrahlung gamma-ray source reaching photon energies of several hundreds of MeV. Different materials and accelerator configurations were used to optimise the yield of photons and to mitigate the production of secondary particles.
The energetic gamma rays were then collided with the X-ray field emitted by a hot plasma in order to attempt the production of electron-positron pairs from the Breit-Wheeler process.

\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgements}  

\vspace{-0.2cm}

Over the past couple of years, I had the immense privilege to work at world class research facilities alongside brilliant scientists, travel to international schools and conferences, and meet amazing people on the way.
Frequent trips to RAL and long weeks spent at the shed that is Gemini have triggered a (sometimes painful) transformation from a practically inept phenomenologist to an experimental physicist.
It has been a challenging journey, but I am grateful and have learned an awful lot.

I feel particularly lucky to have experienced the incomparable bond that is forged through coffee-fuelled late nights in climate-controlled labs.
It is a fellowship united in a quest for `that sweet data' but also in our suffering, to ultimately either share `eternal glory' or see the sun rise without it on the final night of beam time.
Experiments would not have been the same without on-point tunes, good craic and class people: 
amongst many others, Sav, Rob, Nic, Amina, Michael, and  -- the QED crew -- Guillermo, Brendan, Dominik, Matt, Cary, Eva, the Chrises, Harsh, Christian, it was an honour and absolute pleasure to serve with you.
A special shout out to Jason, Jon, Kris, Nelson and Christos for showing us the ropes and being absolute legends in their own way.
Thanks also to the amazing staff at the CLF who work tirelessly to make our experiments a success.

A warm thank you, Stuart, for having been a great supervisor, a supportive guide and mentor on this journey, for always keeping your door open for stimulating discussions and reminding me of the big picture.
I also want to thank you and Zulf for giving me the opportunity to work on so many fascinating (even if frustrating) experiments.

Thanks to Brendan, Sebastian, Steve and again Stuart for proofreading and offering words of encouragement, and to Tom for letting me use his beautiful figures.

A shout out to my cohort -- Sav, Emma, Sam, Jon, Henry, Catalina, and in some way Meriame -- and to everyone at Imperial who made this an unforgettable experience and kept me sane with tea breaks, crosswords, Christmas parties, orchestra rehearsals and pub visits.
Thanks to Ollie and Rob for being there in the end and checking in on me.

Thanks to my friends outside the field, in particular Shayan, Patrick and Frederik, for having my back and for coping with sudden periods of radio silence.

To Judite, for experiencing the highs and lows together with me, for celebrating the successes and for supporting me on darker days, thank you for being there for me.

To my family, in particular my parents: thank you for always being there for me, for your unconditional love and unending support in every situation. 
This would not have been possible without your help.

%I would also like to gratefully acknowledge the joint funding of the John Adams Institute and the Virtual Helmholtz Institute.

\chapter*{Role of the Author}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Role of the Author}  

The results presented in this work were obtained on experimental campaigns at the \textsc{Gemini} laser of the Central Laser Facility (CLF), Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL), UK. On all three experiments, the author was part of a sizeable experimental team supported by the capable local staff of engineers, laser and link scientists, that facilitated the success of these campaigns.

The analysis of the gathered data presented here was conducted by the author unless acknowledged or indicated otherwise.
The specific role of the author and contributions of other researchers were as follows:
% in the context of the experimental campaigns and results presented in this work were as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Chapter \ref{Chap:linICS}}: The author led the planning and coordination of the experimental campaign, during which he had the role of the Target Area Operator together with Matthew Streeter (IC) and Brendan Kettle (IC). Matthew Streeter characterised focal spots and FROG data. Cary Colgan (IC) analysed interferometry images and provided density profiles for the gas target.

\item \textbf{Chapter \ref{Chap:RR15}}: During the experimental campaign, the author was mainly responsible for setting up the electron spectrometer. The author analysed the electron spectrometer data, surveyed data to find suitable datasets, and correlated the gamma spectrometer yield with the electron spectra to identify successful collisions. Tom Blackburn (Chalmers) provided simulations. Jason Cole (IC) and Keegan Behm (Michigan) analysed the gamma spectrometer data. Jason Cole correlated the experimental and the simulation results and wrote the paper.

\item \textbf{Chapter \ref{Chap:BW}}: The author was involved in planning and coordination of the campaign, and was Target Area Operator together with Brendan Kettle (IC) and Guillermo Marrero Samarin (QUB) during the experiment. The author analysed data from the electron and the gamma spectrometer. Brendan Kettle and Guillermo Marrero Samarin analysed the data from the gamma profile screen and the single-particle diagnostics. Cary Colgan (IC) and Brendan Kettle set up and analysed the X-ray diagnostics. Dominik Hollatz (Jena) set up and simulated the magnetic chicane.
\end{itemize}

Stuart Mangles (IC) was the principal investigator (PI) for all three experiments.
