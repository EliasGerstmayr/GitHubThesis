\chapter*{Abstract}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Abstract}  

The driving theme of this thesis is the experimental production and characterisation of high-energy gamma radiation using a laser wakefield accelerator (LWFA), and its application in the context of studies of fundamental QED phenomena.
\vspace{\baselineskip}

An electron beam from shock injection of an energy up to $1.3\,\mathrm{GeV}$ was collided with a laser pulse at an intensity of $a_0 \sim 0.2 - 1$ producing 10's of MeV photons from linear inverse Compton scattering. The emitted radiation was used to diagnose the properties of the electron beam and of the laser pulse at the interaction. It was demonstrated that this can also be used to systematically facilitate the spatio-temporal overlap of the electron beam and the laser pulse in future radiation reaction studies.
\vspace{\baselineskip}

A relativistic electron beam of energy $\epsilon > 500\,\mathrm{MeV}$ was collided with a tightly focused laser pulse with $a_0 \sim 10$. The interaction generated broadband synchrotron-like radiation from non-linear inverse Compton scattering with critical energies $\epsilon_{crit} > 30\,\mathrm{MeV}$, which are the highest ICS photon energies reported from an all-optical setup at this time. The high photon energies in turn enabled a significant measurement of energy loss in the electron beam rendering this the first published measurement of radiation reaction in an LWFA setup.
\vspace{\baselineskip}

An electron beam from LWFA was used to commission a bremsstrahlung gamma-ray source reaching photon energies of several hundreds of MeV. Different materials and accelerator configurations were used to optimise the yield of photons and to mitigate the production of secondary particles.
The energetic gamma rays were then collided with the X-ray field emitted by a hot plasma in order to attempt to produce electron-positron pairs from the Breit-Wheeler process.

\chapter*{Role of the Author}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Role of the Author}  

The results presented in this work were obtained on experimental campaigns at the \textsc{Gemini} laser of the Central Laser Facility (CLF), Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL), UK. On all three experiments the author was part of a sizeable experimental team supported by the capable local staff of engineers, laser and link scientists, that facilitated the success of these campaigns.

The analysis of the gathered data presented in this work was conducted by the author unless acknowledged or indicated otherwise.
The specific role of the author and contributions of other researchers in the context of the experimental campaigns and results presented in this work were as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Chapter \ref{Chap:linICS}}: The author lead the planning and coordination of the experimental campaign, during which he had the role of the Target Area Operator together with Matthew Streeter (IC) and Brendan Kettle (IC). Matthew Streeter characterised focal spots and FROG data. Cary Colgan (IC) analysed interferometry images and provided density profiles for the gas target.

\item \textbf{Chapter \ref{Chap:RR15}}: During the experimental campaign the author was mainly responsible for setting up the electron spectrometer. The author analysed the electron spectrometer data, surveyed data to find suitable datasets, and correlated the gamma spectrometer yield with the electron spectra to identify successful collisions. Tom Blackburn (Chalmers) provided simulations. Jason Cole (IC) and Keegan Behm (Michigan) analysed the gamma spectrometer data. Jason Cole correlated the experimental and the simulation results and wrote the paper.

\item \textbf{Chapter \ref{Chap:BW}}: The author was involved in planning and coordination of the campaign, and was Target Area Operator together with Brendan Kettle (IC) and Guillermo Marrero Samarin (QUB) during the experiment. The author analysed data from the electron and the gamma spectrometer. Brendan Kettle and Guillermo Marrero Samarin analysed the data from the gamma profile screen and the single-particle diagnostics. Cary Colgan (IC) and Brendan Kettle set up and analysed the X-ray diagnostics. Dominik Hollatz (Jena) set up and simulated the magnetic chicane.
\end{itemize}

Stuart Mangles (IC) was the principal investigator (PI) for all three experiments.
