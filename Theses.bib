abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, IMechE 2017. As the main bearing components of vehicle wheel/rail systems, railway bearings take on the main load of wheel/rail system. These bearings can be easily damaged after a long-term load, which causes vibrations and significant deterioration of force distribution and directly affects the driving stability of the locomotive. Current systems available for modeling the dynamics of wheel/rail systems rarely consider nonlinear contact load bearing, which causes errors in the calculation of wheel/rail system dynamics. According to the bearing structure characteristics and working features of a specific system, this paper thoroughly evaluates the flexible deformation of shaft and bearing, time-varying nonlinear contact load, track irregularity, and bearing to establish a wheel/rail system coupling dynamics model. Then, based on the coupling dynamics theoretical model, the wheel/rail system's coupling nonlinear dynamic characteristics are studied under random load. Then, this theoretical model of the wheel–bearing–rail system dynamics is verified using the railway bearing as an example. Finally, the model is applied to the process of rail/wheel low force design. Results show that under irregular stimulation, the maximum contact load increased by 71.2{\%} and the maximum contact stress increased by 19.6{\%}. After moderate wear, the wheel/rail system vibration and loading condition deteriorate rapidly. Under the low rail/wheel force, the wheel tread and diameter had significant effects on wheel/rail contact force distribution. The rail specifications are found to affect the wheel/rail system's vibration significantly. This paper has important theoretical value and practical significance for developing reliable railway bearings and wheel/rail systems with good static/dynamic characteristics that can withstand dynamic impact load.},
