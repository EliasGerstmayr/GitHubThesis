abstract = {Expressions are obtained for the probability of ionization of atoms and solid bodies in the field of a strong electromagnetic wave whose frequency is lower than the ionization potential. In the limiting case of low frequencies these expressions change into the well known formulas for the probability of tunnel auto-ionization; at high frequencies they describe processes in which several photons are absorbed simultaneously. The ionization probability has a number of resonance maxima due to intermediate transition of the atom to an excited state. In the vicinity of such a maximum the ionization cross section increases by several orders of mag- nitude. The positions and widths of the resonances depend on the field strength in the wave. It is shown that for optical frequencies the mechanism under consideration, of direct ioniza- tion by the wave field, may be significant in the case of electric breakdown in gases, and es- pecially in condensed media.},
