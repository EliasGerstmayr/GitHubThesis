abstract = {High-energy particle accelerators have been crucial in providing a deeper understanding of fundamental particles and the forces that govern their interactions. To increase the energy of the particles or to reduce the size of the accelerator, new acceleration schemes need to be developed. Plasma wakefield acceleration1–5, in which the electrons in a plasma are excited, leading to strong electric fields (so called ‘wakefields'), is one such promising acceleration technique. Experiments have shown that an intense laser pulse6–9 or electron bunch10,11 traversing a plasma can drive electric fields of tens of gigavolts per metre and above—well beyond those achieved in conventional radio-frequency accelerators (about 0.1 gigavolt per metre). However, the low stored energy of laser pulses and electron bunches means that multiple acceleration stages are needed to reach very high particle energies5,12. The use of proton bunches is compelling because they have the potential to drive wakefields and to accelerate electrons to high energy in a single acceleration stage13. Long, thin proton bunches can be used because they undergo a process called self-modulation14–16, a particle–plasma interaction that splits the bunch longitudinally into a series of high-density microbunches, which then act resonantly to create large wakefields. The Advanced Wakefield (AWAKE) experiment at CERN17–19 uses high-intensity proton bunches—in which each proton has an energy of 400 gigaelectronvolts, resulting in a total bunch energy of 19 kilojoules—to drive a wakefield in a ten-metre-long plasma. Electron bunches are then injected into this wakefield. Here we present measurements of electrons accelerated up to two gigaelectronvolts at the AWAKE experiment, in a demonstration of proton-driven plasma wakefield acceleration. Measurements were conducted under various plasma conditions and the acceleration was found to be consistent and reliable. The potential for this scheme to produce very high-energy electron bunches in a single accelerating stage20 means that our results are an important step towards the development of future high-energy particle accelerators21,22.},

These so-called spatio-temporal couplings constitute a broad range of physical effects, which often become important in applications. In this review, we compile some recent experimental and theoretical work on the understanding, avoidance and applications of these effects. We first present a discussion of the characteristics of pulses containing spatio-temporal couplings, including their sources, a mathematical description and the interdependence of different couplings. We then review different experimental methods for their characterization. Finally, we describe different applications of spatio-temporal couplings and suggest further schemes for their exploitation and avoidance.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Author(s). A comparative experimental study of betatron x-ray radiation from laser wakefield acceleration in the blowout and self-modulated regimes is presented. Our experiments use picosecond duration laser pulses up to 150 J (self-modulated regime) and 60 fs duration laser pulses up to 10 J (blowout regime), for plasmas with electronic densities on the order of 10 19 cm -3 . In the self-modulated regime, where betatron radiation has been very little studied compared to the blowout regime, electrons accelerated in the wake of the laser pulse are subject to both the longitudinal plasma and transverse laser electrical fields. As a result, their motion within the wake is relatively complex; consequently, the experimental and theoretical properties of the x-ray source based on self-modulation differ from the blowout regime of laser wakefield acceleration. In our experimental configuration, electrons accelerated up to about 250 MeV and betatron x-ray spectra with critical energies of about 10-20 keV and photon fluxes between 10 8 and 10 10 photons/eV Sr are reported. Our experiments open the prospect of using betatron x-ray radiation for applications, and the source is competitive with current x-ray backlighting methods on multi-kilojoule laser systems.},

abstract = {Laser-wakefield accelerators (LWFAs) were proposed more than three decades ago, and while they promise to deliver compact, high energy particle accelerators, they will also provide the scientific community with novel light sources. In a LWFA, where an intense laser pulse focused onto a plasma forms an electromagnetic wave in its wake, electrons can be trapped and are now routinely accelerated to GeV energies. From terahertz radiation to gamma-rays, this article reviews light sources from relativistic electrons produced by LWFAs, and discusses their potential applications. Betatron motion, Compton scattering and undulators respectively produce x-rays or gamma-rays by oscillating relativistic electrons in the wakefield behind the laser pulse, a counter-propagating laser field, or a magnetic undulator. Other LWFA-based light sources include bremsstrahlung and terahertz radiation. We first evaluate the performance of each of these light sources, and compare them with more conventional approaches, including radio frequency accelerators or other laser-driven sources. We have then identified applications, which we discuss in details, in a broad range of fields: medical and biological applications, military, defense and industrial applications, and condensed matter and high energy density science.},

abstract = {The intrinsic constraints in the amplitude of the accelerating fields sustainable by radio-frequency accelerators demand for the pursuit of alternative and more compact acceleration schemes. Among these, plasma-based accelerators are arguably the most promising, thanks to the high-accelerating fields they can sustain, greatly exceeding the GeV/m. While plasma-based acceleration of electrons is now sufficiently mature for systematic studies in this direction, positron acceleration is still at its infancy, with limited projects currently undergoing to provide a viable test facility for further experiments. In this article, we propose a recently demonstrated laser-driven configuration as a relatively compact and inexpensive source of high-quality ultra-relativistic positrons for laser-driven and particle-driven plasma wakefield acceleration studies. Monte-Carlo simulations show that near-term high-intensity laser facilities can produce positron beams with high-current, femtosecond-scale duration, and sufficiently low normalised emittance at energies in the GeV range to be injected in further acceleration stages.

abstract = {The Working Group I contribution to the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) considers new evidence of climate change based on many independent scientific analyses from observations of the climate system, paleoclimate archives, theoretical studies of climate processes and simulations using climate models. It builds upon the Working Group I contribution to the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), and incorporates subsequent new findings of research. As a component of the fifth assessment cycle, the IPCC Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (SREX) is an important basis for information on changing weather and climate extremes. This Summary for Policymakers (SPM) follows the structure of the Working Group I report. The narrative is supported by a series of overarching highlighted conclusions which, taken together, provide a concise summary. Main sections are introduced with a brief paragraph in italics which outlines the methodological basis of the assessment. The degree of certainty in key findings in this assessment is based on the author teams' evaluations of underlying scientific understanding and is expressed as a qualitative level of confidence (from very low to very high) and, when possible, probabilistically with a quantified likelihood (from exceptionally unlikely to virtually certain). Confidence in the validity of a finding is based on the type, amount, quality, and consistency of evidence (e.g., data, mechanistic understanding, theory, models, expert judgment) and the degree of agreement1. Probabilistic estimates of quantified measures of uncertainty in a finding are based on statistical analysis of observations or model results, or both, and expert judgment2. Where appropriate, findings are also formulated as statements of fact without using uncertainty qualifiers. (See Chapter 1 and Box TS.1 for more details about the specific language the IPCC uses to communicate uncertainty) The basis for substantive paragraphs in this Summary for Policymakers can be found in the chapter sections of the underlying report and in the Technical Summary.

abstract = {The Jefferson LabQweakexperiment determined the weak charge of the proton by measuring the parity-violating elastic scattering asymmetry of longitudinally polarized electrons from an unpolarized liquid hydrogen target at small momentum transfer. A custom apparatus was designed for this experiment to meet the technical challenges presented by the smallest and most precise e→p asymmetry ever measured. Technical milestones were achieved at Jefferson Lab in target power, beam current, beam helicity reversal rate, polarimetry, detected rates, and control of helicity-correlated beam properties. The experiment employed 180 $\mu$A of 89{\%} longitudinally polarized electrons whose helicity was reversed 960 times per second. The electrons were accelerated to 1.16 GeV and directed to a beamline with extensive instrumentation to measure helicity-correlated beam properties that can induce false asymmetries. M{\o}ller and Compton polarimetry were used to measure the electron beam polarization to better than 1{\%}. The electron beam was incident on a 34.4 cm liquid hydrogen target. After passing through a triple collimator system, scattered electrons between 5.8° and 11.6° were bent in the toroidal magnetic field of a resistive copper-coil magnet. The electrons inside this acceptance were focused onto eight fused silica Cherenkov detectors arrayed symmetrically around the beam axis. A total scattered electron rate of about 7 GHz was incident on the detector array. The detectors were read out in integrating mode by custom-built low-noise pre-amplifiers and 18-bit sampling ADC modules. The momentum transfer Q2=0.025 GeV2was determined using dedicated low-current ({\~{}}100pA) measurements with a set of drift chambers before (and a set of drift chambers and trigger scintillation counters after) the toroidal magnet.},

abstract = {The capability of plasmas to sustain ultrahigh electric fields has attracted considerable interest over the last decades and has given rise to laser-plasma engineering. Today, plasmas are commonly used for accelerating and collimating relativistic electrons, or to manipulate intense laser pulses. Here we propose an ultracompact plasma undulator that combines plasma technology and nanoengineering. When coupled with a laser-plasma accelerator, this undulator constitutes a millimetre-sized synchrotron radiation source of X-rays. The undulator consists of an array of nanowires, which are ionized by the laser pulse exiting from the accelerator. The strong charge-separation field, arising around the wires, efficiently wiggles the laser-accelerated electrons. We demonstrate that this system can produce bright, collimated and tunable beams of photons with 10-100 keV energies. This concept opens a path towards a new generation of compact synchrotron sources based on nanostructured plasmas.},

It is shown that this radiation mechanism can be implemented experimentally either by the collision of low-density electron beams with different transverse sizes or by the counter injection of denser equal-size beams unstable against filamentation perturbations.

abstract = {Particle-in-cell (PIC) methods have a long history in the study of laser-plasma interactions. Early electromagnetic codes used the Yee staggered grid for field variables combined with a leapfrog EM-field update and the Boris algorithm for particle pushing. The general properties of such schemes are well documented. Modern PIC codes tend to add to these high-order shape functions for particles, Poisson preserving field updates, collisions, ionisation, a hybrid scheme for solid density and high-field QED effects. In addition to these physics packages, the increase in computing power now allows simulations with real mass ratios, full 3D dynamics and multi-speckle interaction. This paper presents a review of the core algorithms used in current laser-plasma specific PIC codes. Also reported are estimates of self-heating rates, convergence of collisional routines and test of ionisation models which are not readily available elsewhere. Having reviewed the status of PIC algorithms we present a summary of recent applications of such codes in laser-plasma physics, concentrating on SRS, short-pulse laser-solid interactions, fast-electron transport, and QED effects.},

abstract = {As new laser facilities are developed with intensities on the scale of 10{\^{}}22 - 10{\^{}}24 W cm{\^{}}-2 , it becomes ever more important to understand the effect of strong field quantum electrodynamics processes, such as quantum radiation reaction, which will play a dominant role in laser-plasma interactions at these intensities. Recent all-optical experiments, where GeV electrons from a laser wakefield accelerator encountered a counter-propagating laser pulse with a{\_}0 {\textgreater} 10, have produced evidence of radiation reaction, but have not conclusively identified quantum effects nor their most suitable theoretical description. Here we show the number of collisions and the conditions required to accomplish this, based on a simulation campaign of radiation reaction experiments under realistic conditions. We conclude that while the critical energy of the photon spectrum distinguishes classical and quantum-corrected models, a better means of distinguishing the stochastic and deterministic quantum models is the change in the electron energy spread. This is robust against shot-to-shot fluctuations and the necessary laser intensity and electron beam energies are already available. For example, we show that so long as the electron energy spread is below 25{\%}, collisions at a{\_}0 = 10 with electron energies of 500 MeV could differentiate between different quantum models in under 30 shots, even with shot to shot variations at the 50{\%} level.},

abstract = {In the laser --- electron beam head-on interaction electron energy can decrease due to radiation reaction, i.e. emission of photons. For 10--100{\~{}}fs laser pulses and for the laser field strength up to the pair photoproduction threshold, it is shown that one can calculate the resulting electron and photon spectra as if the electron beam travels through a constant magnetic field. The strength of this constant field and the interaction time are found as functions of the laser field amplitude and duration. Using of constant field approximation can make a theoretical analysis of stochasticity of the radiation reaction much more simple in comparison with the case of alternating laser field, also, it allows one to get electron and photon spectra much cheaper numerically than by particle-in-cell simulations.},

The plasma is created by ionising a gas in a gas cell with a multi-TW laser system. The plasma wave will be driven by high-current-density electron beams from the FLASH linear accelerator. The laser system can also be used to provide optical diagnostics of the plasma and electron beams due to the {\textless}30 fs synchronisation between the laser and the driving electron beam. The project will explore both external and internal witness-beam injection techniques. The operation parameters of the experiment are discussed, as well as the scientific programme.},

Past research has focused on creating large-amplitude plasma waves by injecting an intense laser pulse or an electron bunch into the plasma. However, the maximum energy gain of electrons accelerated in a single plasma stage is limited by the energy of the driver. Proton bunches are the most promising drivers of wakefields to accelerate electrons to the TeV energy scale in a single stage. An experimental program at CERN -- the AWAKE experiment -- has been launched to study in detail the important physical processes and to demonstrate the power of proton-driven plasma wakefield acceleration.

The plasma and magnetic field parameters inside the capillary discharge are described theoretically and modeled with dissipative magnetohydrodynamic computer simulations enabling analysis of the capillaries of rectangle cross-sections. Large aspect ratio rectangular capillaries might be used to transport electron beams with high emittance asymmetries, as well as assist in forming spatially flat electron bunches for final focusing before the interaction point.},

abstract = {The features of electromagnetic processes are considered which connected with finite size of space region in which final particles (photon, electron-positron pair) are formed. The longitudinal dimension of the region is known as the formation length. If some external agent is acting on an electron while traveling this distance the emission process can be d isrupted. There are different agents: multiple scattering of projectile, polarization of a medium, action of external fields, etc. The theory of radiation under influence of the multiple scattering, the Landau- Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) effect, is presented. The probability of radiation is calculated with an accuracy up to "next to leading logarithm" and with the Coulomb corrections taken into account. The integral characteristics of bremsstrahlung are given, it is shown that the effective radiation length increases due to the LPM effect at high energy. The LPM effect for pair creation is also presented. The multiple scattering influences also on radiative corrections in a medium (and an external field too) including the anomalous magnetic moment of an electron and the polarization tensor as well as coherent scattering of a photon in a Coulomb field. The polarization of a medium alters the radiation probability in soft part of spectrum. Specific features of radiation from a target of finite thickness include: the boundary photon emission, interference effects for thin target, multi-photon radiation. The theory predictions are compared with experimental data obtained at SLAC and CERN SPS. For electron-positron colliding beams following items are discussed: the separation of coherent and incoherent mechanisms of radiation, the beam-size effect in bremsstrahlung, coherent radiation and mechanisms of electron-positron creation. {\textcopyright} 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Collisions between high intensity laser pulses and energetic electron beams are now used to measure the transition between the classical and quantum regimes of light-matter interactions. However, the energy spectrum of laser-wakefield-accelerated electron beams can fluctuate significantly from shot to shot, making it difficult to clearly discern quantum effects in radiation reaction, for example. Here we show how this can be accomplished in only a single laser shot. A millimeter-scale pre-collision drift allows the electron beam to expand to a size larger than the laser focal spot and develop a correlation between transverse position and angular divergence. In contrast to previous studies, this means that a measurement of the beam's energy-divergence spectrum automatically distinguishes components of the beam that hit or miss the laser focal spot and therefore do and do not experience radiation reaction.},

abstract = {Over the last 60 years, soil microbiologists have accumulated a wealth of experimental data showing that the usual bulk, macroscopic parameters used to characterize soils (e.g., granulometry, pH, soil organic matter and biomass contents) provide insufficient information to describe quantitatively the activity of soil microorganisms and some of its outcomes, like the emission of greenhouse gases. Clearly, new, more appropriate macroscopic parameters are needed, which reflect better the spatial heterogeneity of soils at the microscale (i.e., the pore scale). For a long time, spectroscopic and microscopic tools were lacking to quantify processes at that scale, but major technological advances over the last 15 years have made suitable equipment available to researchers. In this context, the objective of the present article is to review progress achieved to date in the significant research program that has ensued. This program can be rationalized as a sequence of steps, namely the quantification and modeling of the physical-, (bio)chemical-, and microbiological properties of soils, the integration of these different perspectives into a unified theory, its upscaling to the macroscopic scale, and, eventually, the development of new approaches to measure macroscopic soil characteristics. At this stage, significant progress has been achieved on the physical front, and to a lesser extent on the (bio)chemical one as well, both in terms of experiments and modeling. In terms of microbial aspects, whereas a lot of work has been devoted to the modeling of bacterial and fungal activity in soils at the pore scale, the appropriateness of model assumptions cannot be readily assessed because relevant experimental data are extremely scarce. For the overall research to move forward, it will be crucial to make sure that research on the microbial components of soil systems does not keep lagging behind the work on the physical and (bio)chemical characteristics. Concerning the subsequent steps in the program, very little integration of the various disciplinary perspectives has occurred so far, and, as a result, researchers have not yet been able to tackle the scaling up to the macroscopic level. Many challenges, some of them daunting, remain on the path ahead.},

The spectrum and the colours of EROS1, the first candidate, reveal that it is a moderately reddened main-sequence B star with H emission lines. The presence of H absorption lines seems to be more the signature of a normal star than that of a cataclysmic variable. As to EROS2, the second candidate, its spectrum and photometry are those of an unreddened normal main-sequence A star, but it cannot be totally excluded that they represent those of a nova in the pre-outburst phase. Although it is not yet possible to exclude intrinsic stellar variations, the interpretation in terms of microlensing effects remain the most natural one.},

@misc{Behling2017,
abstract = {This paper compares very different physical principles of X-ray production to spur ideation. Since more than 120 years, bremsstrahlung from X-ray tubes has been the workhorse of medical diagnostics. Generated by X-ray segments comprised of X-ray tubes and high-voltage generators in the various medical systems, X-ray photons in the spectral range between about 16 keV and 150 keV deliver information about anatomy and function of human patients and in pre-clinical animal studies. Despite of strides to employ the wave nature of X-rays as phase sensitive means, commercial diagnostic X-ray systems available until the time of writing still rely exclusively on measuring the attenuation and scattering of X-rays by matter. Significant activities in research aim at building highly brilliant short pulse X-ray sources, based on e.g. synchrotron radiation, free electron lasers and/or laser wake-field acceleration of electrons followed by wiggling with magnetic structures or Thomson scattering in bunches of light. While both approaches, non-brilliant and brilliant sources, have different scope of application, we speculate that a combination may expand the efficacy in medical application. At this point, however, severe technical and commercial difficulties hinder closing this gap. This article may inspire further development and spark innovation in this important field.},

By colliding a laser wakefield accelerated electron beam with a tightly focused, intense laser pulse, gamma-ray photons up to 100 MeV energies and with few femtosecond duration may be produced. To measure the energy spectrum and angular distribution, a 33 × 47 array of cesium-iodide crystals was oriented such that the 47 crystal length axis was parallel to the gamma-ray beam and the 33 crystal length axis was oriented in the vertical direction. Using an iterative deconvolution method similar to the YOGI code, modeling of the scintillator response using GEANT4 and fitting to a quantum Monte Carlo calculated photon spectrum, we are able to extract the gamma ray spectra generated by the inverse Compton interaction.

Peak laser intensities of 0.51018 W/cm2 have been achieved, corresponding to a value of 0.4 for the parameter eErms /m2c3, where Erms is the rms electric field strength of the laser in the electron rest frame. We present eErms /m 0c and to a value of 0.25 for the parameter eErms /Ecrit data on the scattered electron spectra arising from nonlinear Compton scattering with up to four photons absorbed from the field. A convolved spectrum of the forward high energy photons is also given. The observed positron production rate depends on the fifth power of the laser intensity, as expected for a process where five photons are absorbed from the field. The positrons are interpreted as arising from the collision of a high-energy Compton scattered photon with the laser beam. The results are found to be in agreement with theoretical predictions.

abstract = {1. General Method.-In order to obtain the rate of loss of energy of a particle by emission of radiation, we have to calculate the transition probability for the following process : a particle with momentum'!' p 0/c and energy E 0 makes a transition to a state with the momentum p/c and energy E, while a light quantum with the momentum k/c is emitted, the frequency v being given by Jc-hv = E 0-E. (2) The perturbation causing this transition is the interaction of the particle with the nuclear field V = Ze2Jr and with the radiation field H =-e (aA), where A is the vector potential of the radiation field and a is Dirac's three-dimensional matrix-vector signifying the velocity. The wave functions of the electron describing the initial and the final state are supposed to be plane waves, the atomic field being only con­ sidered as a perturbation. This corresponds to the first approximation of Born's collision theory, which was shown by Bethe (loc. cit.) to hold for Z/137 {\textless} vjc. For fast particles (v c) this is always true, if Z is not too large. For lead, however, it is doubtful whether the calculations give quantitatively correct results. But from the experiments it seems that, at least for the twin birth, see {\S} 8, the error is very small. The transition from the initial to the final state, however, only occurs under the simultaneous action of both the atomic field and that of the light wave. First, the electron goes, under the influence of one of the said perturbations, from the initial state to an intermediate state (conservation of energy does not necessarily hold here); then a second transition immediately happens to the final state, caused by the other perturbation. Since momentum is conserved in the emission of light, it can easily be seen (cf.},

abstract = {All perturbative approaches to quantum electrodynamics (QED) break down in the collision of a high-energy electron beam with an intense laser, when the laser fields are boosted to 'supercritical' strengths greater than the critical field of QED. This leads to cascades of photon emission and electron-positron pair creation, as well as the onset of substantial radiative corrections. We identify the important role played by the collision angle in mitigating energy losses to photon emission that would otherwise prevent the electrons reaching the supercritical regime. We show that a collision between an electron beam with energy in the tens of GeV and a laser pulse of intensity 10 24 Wcm −2 at, crucially, normal incidence is a viable platform for studying the breakdown of perturbative strong-field QED. Our results have implications for the design of near-term experiments as they predict that certain quantum effects are enhanced at oblique incidence. Experimental exploration of nonperturbative quantum electrodynamics (QED) is challenging as large electromagnetic fields comparable to the critical field of QED E cr = 1.3 × 10 18 Vm −1 [1, 2] are required. Nevertheless, ever-increasing laser intensities [3-5] make it possible to probe fields that are effectively supercritical, i.e., have magnitude greater than E cr. This is achieved using the Lorentz boost when ultrarelativistic electrons collide with an intense laser pulse [6, 7], as the parameter $\chi$ e that controls the importance of nonlinear QED is the rest-frame electric field normalized to the critical field strength. $\chi$ e is covariantly expressed as $\chi$ e = |F µ$\nu$ u $\nu$ |/E cr [8], where F is the electromagnetic field tensor, u the electron four-velocity, and E cr = m 2 /e is the critical field strength. We use natural units in which = c = 1 (e is the elementary charge, m the electron mass) throughout. In the supercritical regime $\chi$ e 1, particle dynamics is dominated by cascades of photon emission and electron-positron pair creation [8-11]. The importance of studying these phenomena is motivated by their relevance to high-field astrophysical environments, such as magnetars [12-14], and to laser-matter interactions beyond the current intensity frontier [15, 16]. It is also of considerable theoretical interest, as when $\alpha$$\chi$ 2/3 e approaches unity ($\alpha$ is the fine-structure constant), radia-tive corrections to quantum processes become so large that all current, perturbative, predictions fail [17, 18] and strong-field QED becomes fully nonperturbative. In this Letter we show how the collision of an intense laser pulse with an ultrarelativistic electron beam may be used to probe the supercritical regime. A significant obstacle to this is posed by radiation reaction, an accelerating charge's loss of energy to photon emission, which strongly reduces u at $\chi$ e 1, thereby suppressing $\chi$ e itself [19-22]. We show that this can be mitigated by appropriate choice of the angle at which the beams collide. We present a theoretical expression for the maximum $\chi$ e , which predicts, contrary to the expectation that the ideal geometry is counterpropagation, that oblique incidence is favoured for laser pulses of high intensity or long duration. This enhances certain quantum effects on radiation reaction, namely straggling [23, 24] and stochastic broadening [25]. As a result, not only will laser-electron collision experiments that are practically constrained to oblique incidence [26] still detect signatures of quantum effects, but these signatures can be stronger than they would be in a head-on collision. Furthermore, we show that at the intensity and electron energy necessary to probe radiative corrections, normal incidence is strongly favoured to reduce radiative losses that would otherwise prevent reaching such high $\chi$ e. High-power lasers compress energy into ultrashort pulses that can be focussed almost to the diffraction limit. The theoretical upper bound on $\chi$ e is obtained by treating the laser as a pulsed plane electromagnetic wave with peak dimensionless amplitude a 0 = eE 0 /(m$\omega$ 0), peak electric field strength E 0 and central frequency $\omega$ 0 , and neglecting radiative losses. Then $\chi$ e = a 0 $\gamma$ 0 $\omega$ 0 (1 + cos $\theta$) m (1) where $\theta$ is the collision angle (defined to be zero for coun-terpropagation) and $\gamma$ 0 1 is the initial Lorentz factor of the electron. The largest possible quantum parameter is $\chi$ 0 = $\chi$ e ($\theta$ = 0). Experiments at a 0 0.4, $\chi$ e 0.3 have demonstrated nonlinear QED effects including pair creation [6, 7], and recently evidence of radiation reaction has been reported at a 0 10, $\chi$ e 0.1 [27, 28]. At present, the highest field strengths are equivalent to a 0 50 [29, 30], or $\chi$ 0 1 at $\gamma$ 0 m 1 GeV; a 0 {\textgreater} 100 is expected in the next generation of high-intensity laser facilities [31, 32]. The stronger the electromagnetic field, the lower the electron energy that is needed to reach high $\chi$ e. In experiments with aligned crystals where the field strength ∼ 10 13 Vm −1 [33], $\chi$ e 1 and evidence of quantum},

abstract = {The recoil associated with photon emission is key to the dynamics of ultrarelativistic electrons in strong electromagnetic fields, as are found in high-intensity laser-matter interactions and astrophysical environments such as neutron star magnetospheres. When the energy of the photon becomes comparable to that of the electron, it is necessary to use quantum electrodynamics (QED) to describe the dynamics accurately. However, computing the appropriate scattering matrix element from strong-field QED is not generally possible due to multiparticle effects and the complex structure of the electromagnetic fields. Therefore these interactions are treated semiclassically, coupling probabilistic emission events to classical electrodynamics using rates calculated in the locally constant field approximation. Here we provide comprehensive benchmarking of this approach against the exact QED calculation for nonlinear Compton scattering of electrons in an intense laser pulse. We find agreement at the percentage level between the photon spectra, as well as between the models' predictions of absorption from the background field, for normalized amplitudes {\$}a{\_}0 {\textgreater} 5{\$}. We discuss possible routes towards improved numerical methods and the implications of our results for the study of QED cascades.},

abstract = {Classical theories of radiation reaction predict that the electron motion is confined to the plane defined by the electron's instantaneous momentum and the force exerted by the external electromagnetic field. However, in the quantum radiation reaction regime, where the recoil exerted by individual quanta becomes significant, the electron can scatter `out-of-plane', as the photon is emitted into a cone with finite opening angle. We show that Monte Carlo implementation of an angularly resolved emission rate leads to substantially improved agreement with exact QED calculations of nonlinear Compton scattering. Furthermore, we show that the transverse recoil caused by this finite beaming, while negligible in many high-intensity scenarios, can be identified in the increase in divergence, in the plane perpendicular to the polarization, of a high-energy electron beam that interacts with a linearly polarized, ultraintense laser.},

abstract = {Expressions are derived for the total energy loss and photon-production spectrum by the processes of Compton scatter- ing, bremsstrahlung, and synchrotron radiation from highly relativistic electrons. For Compton scattering, the general case, the Thomson limit, and the extreme Klein —Nishina limit are considered. Bremsstrahlung is treated for the cases where the electron is scattered by a pure Coulomb field and by an atom. For the latter case the effects of shielding are discussed extensively. The synchrotron spectrum is derived for an electron moving in a circular orbit perpendicular to the magnetic field and also for the general case where the electron's motion is helical. The total photon-production spec- trum is derived for each process when there is a power-law distribution of electron energies. The problems of the eBects of the three processes on the electron distribution itself are considered. It is shown that if the electron loses a small frac- tion of its energy in a single occurrence of a process, the electron distribution function satisfies a continuity equation which is a differential equation in energy space. For the more general case where the electron can Jose energy in discrete amounts (as in bremsstrahlung and extreme Klein—Nishina Compton losses), the electron distribution function satis6es an integro-differential equation. Some approximate solutions to this equation are derived for certain special cases.},

The laser field is described as an ideal pulse with a finite duration, a fixed direction of propagation, and indefinitely extended in the plane perpendicular to it. This allows the use of Volkov solutions and leads to a transition amplitude which is a product of a three-dimensional delta function with a linear combination of three one-dimensional integrals that we evaluate numerically. We give the general expression of the emitted photon spectrum as a function of frequency and direction valid for any initial geometry of the electron-laser beam scattering and for arbitrary shape, duration, and polarization of the laser pulse averaged over the initial electron spin and summed over the emitted photon and ejected electron polarizations. At a fixed photon scattering angle, one obtains a continuous frequency distribution with a succession of maxima located near the discrete values corresponding to the monochromatic case. We present results for head-on collisions and circu- larly polarized laser pulses. Our figures illustrate the dependence of the photon spectrum on pulse parameters duration, shape, and maximum intensity and the role of the initial electron energy.

abstract = {The infrared asymptotics of probability of radiation of twisted photons in an arbitrary scattering process of quantum electrodynamics (QED) in a vacuum is investigated. This asymptotics is universal and corresponds to the radiation produced by a classical current. Such a radiation is known as the edge radiation. We represent it in terms of the twisted photons: the exact analytical formulas for the average number of radiated twisted photons are derived. We find the average projection of the total angular momentum of the edge radiation and the angular momentum per photon. It is shown that the edge radiation can be used as a source of twisted photons with large angular momentum. Moreover, this radiation can be employed as a superradiant coherent source of twisted photons in the infrared domain, in particular, in the THz part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Several general selection rules for the radiation and absorbtion of twisted photons are proved. These selection rules allow one, in particular, to modulate the one-particle radiation probability by means of scattering of charged particles on symmetrically arranged crystals.},

Here we present a method for studying material resistivity in warm dense plasmas in the laboratory, which we relate to the microphysics of brown dwarfs through viscosity and electron collisions. Here we use X-ray polarimetry to determine the resistivity of a sulphur-doped plastic target heated to Brown Dwarf conditions by an ultra-intense laser. The resistivity is determined by matching the plasma physics model to the atomic physics calculations of the measured large, positive, polarization. The inferred resistivity is larger than predicted using standard resistivity models, suggesting that these commonly used models will not adequately describe the resistivity of warm dense plasma related to the viscosity of brown dwarfs.},

Recent developments have shown peak energies reaching into the GeV range and improved stability and control over the energy spectrum and charge. Future applications, such as the development of laboratory X-ray sources with unprecedented peak brilliance or ultrafast time-resolved measurements critically rely on a temporal characterization of the acceleration process and the electron bunch.

abstract = {Interaction of relativistic electron beams with high power lasers can both serve as a secondary light source and as a novel diagnostic tool for various beam parameters. For both applications, it is important to understand the dynamics of the inverse Compton scattering mechanism and the dependence of the scattered light's spectral properties on the interacting laser and electron beam parameters. Measurements are easily misinterpreted due to the complex interplay of the interaction parameters. Here we report the potential of inverse Compton scattering as an advanced diagnostic tool by investigating two of the most influential interaction parameters, namely the laser intensity and the electron beam emittance. Established scaling laws for the spectral bandwidth and redshift of the mean scattered photon energy are refined. This allows for a quantitatively well matching prediction of the spectral shape. Driving the interaction to a nonlinear regime, we spectrally resolve the rise of higher harmonic radiation with increasing laser intensity. Unprecedented agreement with 3D radiation simulations is found, showing the good control and characterization of the interaction. The findings advance the interpretation of inverse Compton scattering measurements into a diagnostic tool for electron beams from laser plasma acceleration. Inverse Compton scattering (ICS) or Thomson backscattering of intense laser pulses off relativistic electrons attracts increasing attention because it can generate ultra-short and narrow bandwidth light pulses, tunable from the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) to the $\gamma$-ray regime, while requiring far lower electron energies than conventional light sources based on magnetic insertion devices 1,2. It offers a novel research tool in a broad range of fundamental and applied science 3,4 , e.g. medical X-ray fluorescence imaging or computed tomography 5,6 , ultra-fast X-ray diffraction in high-energy-density physics 7-9 or ultra-high-intensity-laser matter interactions 10 , photo-nuclear applications and radiography 11-15. The narrow but finite bandwidth of this light source is of particular interest for these applications, which are typically complex and/or destructive processes, enabling for example the detection of a sharp resonance or absorption edge in a certain spectral range within a single exposure while maintaining a low background signal. While conventional accelerator driven Compton light sources 16-21 are well suited for high repetition rate and accordingly high average photon flux, competitive high peak brilliance in a single exposure is difficult to achieve. A promising candidate with unique properties for these applications is a laser wakefield accelerated (LWFA) electron beam 22-24. The ultra-short pulse duration (fs) and accordingly ultra-high peak current, the wide energy tuning range and the compact design are some of the benefits over conventional accelerator technology 25. Furthermore, electron and scattering laser beams are inherently synchronized and suffer less from timing jitter, since they are generated by the same laser oscillator. Although remarkable progress has been made in controlling the LWFA process, in reaching high energies (GeV) 26-28 and high peak currents (tens of kA) 29-31 , operation of an},

abstract = {The interaction of high-energy electrons, positrons, and photons with intense laser pulses is studied in head-on collision geometry. It is shown that electrons and/or positrons undergo a cascade-type process involving multiple emissions of photons. These photons can consequently convert into electron-positron pairs. As a result charged particles quickly lose their energy developing an exponentially decaying energy distribution, which suppresses the emission of high-energy photons, thus reducing the number of electron-positron pairs being generated. Therefore, this type of interaction suppresses the development of the electromagnetic avalanche-type discharge, i.e., the exponential growth of the number of electrons, positrons, and photons does not occur in the course of interaction. The suppression will occur when three-dimensional effects can be neglected in the transverse particle orbits, i.e., for sufficiently broad laser pulses with intensities that are not too extreme. The final distributions of electrons, positrons, and photons are calculated for the case of a high-energy e-beam interacting with a counterstreaming, short intense laser pulse. The energy loss of the e-beam, which requires a self-consistent quantum description, plays an important role in this process, as well as provides a clear experimental observable for the transition from the classical to quantum regime of interaction.},

abstract = {When the parameters of electron - extreme power laser interaction enter the regime of dominated radiation reaction, the electron dynamics changes qualitatively. The adequate theoretical description of this regime becomes crutially important with the use of the radiation friction force either in the Lorentz-Abraham-Dirac form, which possess unphysical runaway solutions, or in the Landau-Lifshitz form, which is a perturbation valid for relatively low electromagnetic wave amplitude. The goal of the present paper is to find the limits of the Landau-Lifshitz radiation force applicability in terms of the electromagnetic wave amplitude and frequency. For this a class of the exact solutions to the nonlinear problems of charged particle motion in the time-varying electromagnetic field is used.},

@article{Burza,
abstract = {A novel approach to implement and control electron injection into the accelerating phase of a laser wakefield accelerator is presented. It utilizes a wire, which is introduced into the flow of a supersonic gas jet creating shock waves and three regions of differing plasma electron density. If tailored appropriately, the laser plasma interaction takes place in three stages: Laser self-compression, electron injection, and acceleration in the second plasma wave period. Compared to self-injection by wave breaking of a nonlinear plasma wave in a constant density plasma, this scheme increases beam charge by up to 1 order of magnitude in the quasimonoenergetic regime. Electron acceleration in the second plasma wave period reduces electron beam divergence by {\%} 25{\%}, and the localized injection at the density downramps results in spectra with less than a few percent relative spread. Plasma-based laser-driven electron accelerators can produce strong longitudinal fields, {\$}100 GV=m, in the collective electron oscillations in the wake of an intense laser pulse [1]. This gives an advantage over conventional accelerators using rf cavities regarding the relatively compact high-power tabletop laser systems readily available [2]. In most experiments, injection of electrons into the accelerating structure relies on breaking of the plasma wave, which can thus self-inject electrons. This scheme is rather simple and quasimonoenergetic beams have been produced [3-5]. Electron beams of low spectral spread and divergence are necessary for these accelerators to be attractive for applications [6-8]. However, the wave breaking process is highly nonlinear, and in order to achieve higher quality beams, means to control the injection process are required. Both the amount of charge and the time of electron injection from the background plasma into the accelerating and focusing phase of the wakefield are crucial [9-11]. Here, self-injection [12-14] is inferior to most schemes with external injection control, such as colliding pulse techniques [15-18], ionization injection [19,20], or gradients in plasma electron density [21-24], which are used in this experiment. At the downwards gradient the plasma wavelength increases rapidly, the plasma wave breaks and electrons are trapped. Shock waves resulting in very abrupt density transitions have been produced previously with a knife edge introduced into a supersonic gas flow [25]. By this, a well-defined shock wave and a density downwards gradient is provided on the laser axis. Alternatively, an auxiliary pulse produced an electron depleted region by formation of an ionization channel followed by hydrody-namic expansion [26,27]. Our experiment relates to these, as plasma densities are modulated on the laser axis to control injection externally. We present a novel, staged, three step, laser wakefield accelerator that utilizes a thin wire crossing the supersonic flow of a gas jet. In this scheme, extremely sharp density transitions and shock waves facilitate gradient injection. These transitions may be of only some microns length [28]. In the first stage, comprised of a constant plasma density prior to reaching the first shock front, the pulse propagates and may thus match itself to the plasma conditions by relativistic self-focusing, self-modulation and temporal compression, with only a negligible amount of charge being trapped. After a variable length, adjustable by the wire position along the optical axis, the laser pulse reaches the second stage, where the first shock front, originating from the wire, in combination with the subsequent expansion fan produces gradients that enable injection. During the transition to the third stage, the plasma density increases from the density-diluted region right above the wire to the final constant density region. The plasma wavelength shrinks rapidly, which under certain circumstances enables a controlled charge transfer of the previously injected electrons from the first into the second plasma wave period. This mechanism, which is driven by inertia, may in addition have a filtering effect on the previously injected charges. The dominant process, however, is a new injection at the second shock front. The proceeding constant density plasma is finally utilized for electron acceleration driven by the already matched laser pulse.},

A 7 TeV LHC bunch is used as the proton driver to create a plasma wakefield which then accelerates electrons to 3$\backslash$,TeV, these then colliding with the other 7 TeV LHC proton beam. Although of very high energy, the collider has a modest projected integrated luminosity of {\$}10-100{\$} pb{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}.

In one setup the initial helicity is zero while in the other it is finite. To see if it is the actual linking or merely the helicity content that influences the dynamics of the system we also consider a setup with unlinked field lines as well as a field configuration in the shape of a trefoil knot. For helical systems the decay of magnetic energy is slowed down by the helicity which decays slowly. It turns out that it is the helicity content, rather than the actual linking, that is significant for the dynamics. ? 2011 International Astronomical Union.},

abstract = {In this paper, we review the main challenges related to laser Thomson scattering on low temperature plasmas. The main features of the triple grating spectrometer used to discriminate Thomson and Raman scattering signals from Rayleigh scattering and stray light are presented. The main parameters influencing the detection limit of Thomson scattering are reviewed. Laser stray light and plasma emission are two limiting factors, but Raman scattering from molecules inside the plasma will further decrease it. In the case of non-thermal plasmas at high pressure, Thomson scattering is the only technique which allows us to obtain the electron density without any prior knowledge of the plasma properties. Moreover, very high 3D spatial and temporal resolutions can easily be achieved. However, special care still needs to be taken to verify that Thomson scattering is non intrusive. The mechanisms that will lead to possible measurement errors are discussed. The wavelength-resolved scattering signal also allows us to get direct information about the electron energy distribution function in the case of incoherent light scattering. Finally, we discuss some recent applications of Thomson scattering on atmospheric pressure plasma jets, but also in the field of electron collision kinetics. Thomson scattering can be applied on atomic but also molecular plasmas. In the latter case, one needs to take into account the possible contribution of rotational Raman scattering.},

The CLIC concept as described in the report is based on high gradient normal-conducting accelerating structures where the RF power for the acceleration of the colliding beams is extracted from a high-current Drive Beam that runs parallel with the main linac. The focus of CLIC R{\&}D over the last years has been on addressing a set of key feasibility issues that are essential for proving the fundamental validity of the CLIC concept. The status of these feasibility studies are described and summarized. The report also includes a technical description of the accelerator components and R{\&}D to develop the most important parts and methods, as well as a description of the civil engineering and technical services associated with the installation. Several larger system tests have been performed to validate the two-beam scheme, and of particular importance are the results from the CLIC test facility at CERN (CTF3). Both the machine and detector/physics studies for CLIC have primarily focused on the 3 TeV implementation of CLIC as a benchmark for the CLIC feasibility. This report also includes specific studies for an initial 500 GeV machine, and some discussion of possible intermediate energy stages. The performance and operation issues related to operation at reduced energy compared to the nominal, and considerations of a staged construction program are included in the final part of the report. The CLIC accelerator study is organized as an international collaboration with 43 partners in 22 countries. An associated report describes the physics potential and experiments at CLIC and a shorter report in preparation will focus on the CLIC implementation strategy, together with a plan for the CLIC R{\&}D studies 2012-2016. Critical and important implementation issues such as cost, power and schedule will be addressed there.},

In order to determine a correct electron spectrum, the pointing angle of an electron beam incident on the spectrometer should be exactly defined. Here, we present a method for absolutely calibrating the electron spectrum by monitoring the pointing angle using a scintillating screen installed in front of a permanent dipole magnet. The ambiguous electron energy due to the pointing instability is corrected by the numerical and analytical calculations based on the relativistic equation of electron motion. It is also possible to estimate the energy spread of the electron beam and determine the energy resolution of the spectrometer using the beam divergence angle that is simultaneously measured on the screen. The calibration method with direct measurement of the spatial profile of an incident electron beam has a simple experimental layout and presents the full range of spatial and spectral information of the electron beams with energies of multi-hundred MeV level, despite the limited energy resolution of the simple electron spectrometer.},

Understanding alveolar dynamics is crucial for treating patients with pulmonary diseases. In-vivo, real-time visualization of the alveoli during respiration has been hampered by active lung movement. Previous studies have been therefore limited to alveoli at lung apices or subpleural alveoli under open thorax conditions. Here we report direct and real-time visualization of alveoli of live intact mice during respiration using tracking X-ray microscopy. Our studies, for the first time, determine the alveolar size of normal mice in respiration without positive end expiratory pressure as 58 ± 14 (mean ± s.d.) $\mu$m on average, accurately measured in the lung bases as well as the apices. Individual alveoli of normal lungs clearly show heterogeneous inflation from zero to {\~{}}25{\%} (6.7 ± 4.7{\%} (mean ± s.d.)) in size. The degree of inflation is higher in the lung bases (8.7 ± 4.3{\%} (mean ± s.d.)) than in the apices (5.7 ± 3.2{\%} (mean ± s.d.)). The fraction of the total tidal volume allocated for alveolar inflation is 34 ± 3.8{\%} (mean ± s.e.m). This study contributes to the better understanding of alveolar dynamics and helps to develop potential treatment options for pulmonary diseases.},

abstract = {Hard X-ray sources from femtosecond (fs) laser-produced plasmas, including the betatron X-rays from laser wakefield-accelerated electrons, have compact sizes, fs pulse duration and fs pump-probe capability, making it promising for wide use in material and biological sciences. Currently the main problem with such betatron X-ray sources is the limited average flux even with ultra-intense laser pulses. Here, we report ultra-bright betatron X-rays can be generated using a clustering gas jet target irradiated with a small size laser, where a ten-fold enhancement of the X-ray yield is achieved compared to the results obtained using a gas target. We suggest the increased X-ray photon is due to the existence of clusters in the gas, which results in increased total electron charge trapped for acceleration and larger wiggling amplitudes during the acceleration. This observation opens a route to produce high betatron average flux using small but high repetition rate laser facilities for applications.},

abstract = {The development of models and the “Virtual Detector for Synchrotron Radiation” (vdsr) code that accurately describe the production of synchrotron radiation are described. These models and code are valid in the classical and linear (single-scattering) quantum regimes and are capable of describing radiation produced from laser-plasma accelerators (LPAs) through a variety of mechanisms including betatron radiation, undulator radiation, and Thomson/Compton scattering. Previous models of classical synchrotron radiation, such as those typically used for undulator radiation, are inadequate in describing the radiation spectra from electrons undergoing small numbers of oscillations. This is due to an improper treatment of a mathematical evaluation at the end points of an integration that leads to an unphysical plateau in the radiation spectrum at high frequencies, the magnitude of which increases as the number of oscillation periods decreases. This is important for betatron radiation from LPAs, in which the betatron strength parameter is large but the number of betatron periods is small. The code vdsr allows the radiation to be calculated in this regime by full integration over each electron trajectory, including end-point effects, and this code is used to calculate betatron radiation for cases of experimental interest. Radiation from Thomson scattering and Compton scattering is also studied with vdsr. For Thomson scattering, radiation reaction is included by using the Sokolov method for the calculation of the electron dynamics. For Compton scattering, quantum recoil effects are considered in vdsr by using Monte Carlo methods. The quantum calculation has been benchmarked with the classical calculation in a classical regime.},

abstract = {A new self-injection scheme is proposed for the laser wakefield accelerator in the nonlinear (bubble) regime using a pair of matched, copropagating laser pulses which yields a low emit-tance, pC electron bunch. By tuning their relative delay and intensity, the subsequent betatron radiation energy can be considerably (×3) enhanced compared to the single pulse scheme for the same total energy. A general condition for the optimal bubble size is derived and verified by particle-in-cell simulations, further demonstrating the advantages of the double-pulse scheme for self-injection. Previously, multi-pulse schemes have been used as a means to achieve ion-ization injection of electrons in higher energy regimes [1]. The bubble regime of electron acceleration [2] is the highly non-linear regime of laser wake field acceleration where the laser pulse intensity is high enough to create an electron-free cavity. Some electrons get trapped in the cavity, are accelerated and start to wiggle around the laser pulse propagation axis, resulting in betatron radiation [3]. In the wiggler regime, the number of emitted photons and photon energy respectively, per electron and period are N $\gamma$ = 4.40 × 10 −12 $\gamma$n e [cm −3 ]r $\beta$ [µm] and ¯ h$\omega$ c [eV] = 5.24×10 −21 $\gamma$ 2 n e [cm −3 ]r $\beta$ [µm] [4]; where N $\gamma$ and ¯ h$\omega$ c are the number and maximum energy of the emitted X-ray photons, respectively; n e is the number density of the accelerated electrons and r $\beta$ is the wiggle amplitude. With two consecutive laser pulses, higher energy gain for electrons, higher beam current [5] and enhanced betatron emission in the nonlinear blowout regime is possible. The double-cavity scheme achieves this firstly by ensuring that the plasma is fully ionized by the leading pulse; secondly, the accumulation and recycling of free electrons at the back of the first cavity provides a concentrated source for the second pulse to enhance the accelerating field behind it. The two separate pulses each carry a fraction of the total energy which would normally be contained in a single pulse. To make more quantitative predictions for the double-pulse scheme we have performed 2D particle-in-cell simulations using the EPOCH code [6], with the aim of finding},

abstract = {We propose a novel injection scheme for laser-driven wakefield acceleration in which controllable localized electron injection is obtained by inserting nanoparticles into a plasma medium. The nanoparticles provide a very confined electric field that triggers localized electron injection where nonlinear plasma waves are excited but not sufficient for background electrons self-injection. We present a theoretical model to describe the conditions and properties of the electron injection in the presence of nanoparticles. Multi-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations demonstrate that the total charge of the injected electron beam can be controlled by the position, number, size, and density of the nanoparticles. The PIC simulation also indicates that a 5-GeV electron beam with an energy spread below 1{\%} can be obtained with a 0.5-PW laser pulse by using the nanoparticle-assisted laser wakefield acceleration. Laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA) is a promising method to realize compact high-energy electron accelerators because of its significant acceleration field beyond 1 GV/cm 1. In the past decade, LWFA has progressed to achieve multi-GeV energies 2-5 , small energy spreads 6 , stable 7 , and high charge 8 electron beams. In LWFA, an intense laser pulse propagating into a plasma expels electrons away from its axis, and the restoring force induced by charge separation leads to recursive electron motion that excites plasma waves. When an electron bunch is injected into the plasma wave, it is rapidly accelerated by the strong electric field in the plasma wave. The electron injection is one of the key features that determine the beam charge and energy spread of the accelerated beam. As electron injection relies mostly on the self-injection scheme triggered by the extreme nonlinear behavior of the plasma waves such as wave breaking 9,10 and plasma wave expansion 11 , it is difficult to control the injected charge, energy spread, and injection position in LWFA. Furthermore, the electron self-injection can be a critical issue in high-repetition-rate LWFA as the available laser intensity is limited because of technological constraints 12,13. To overcome the limitations of self-injection, various electron injection methods have been proposed using colliding laser pulses 14-17 , density gradients 7,18,19 , inner-shell ionization 16,20,21 , and external magnetic fields 22. However, these methods suffer from issues such as disturbed acceleration process, difficulties in controlling the charge and energy spread, and poor injection position stability. Thus, a controllable and localized electron injection scheme without disturbing the acceleration process would be essential for improving the electron beam properties, which is still a challenge. Electron injection is a serious issue that prevents higher electron energies from being achieved in LWFA. The electron energy can, in principle, be increased by applying a higher laser power to a plasma with lower densities and longer lengths. As the plasma density decreases, however, the electron injection threshold rises because of the higher phase velocity of the plasma wave 23. Thus, the plasma density should be higher than the threshold for self-injection at a given laser power, which limits the possible acceleration length. This conflicting behavior between the electron injection and acceleration process restricts the enhancement of electron energy. Therefore, a novel electron injection scheme is desirable to improve the achievable electron energies beyond the limitations of current injection methods. In this article, we propose a controllable electron injection scheme using nanoparticles inserted into a plasma medium. The nanoparticle is ionized by the leading edge of the laser pulse, and the electric field of the ionized},

In this work, we explored the two regimes of laser propagation in plasma, one with a 0 {\textless} 1 and other with a 0 10. For a 0 {\textless} 1 case, we used a cold relativistic fluid model, wherein apart from immobile ions no further approximations are made. The effect of the laser pulse amplitude, pulse duration, and plasma density is studied using the fluid model and compared with the expected scaling laws and also with the PIC simulations. The agreement between the fluid model and the PIC simulations are found to be excellent. Furthermore, for a 0 10 case, we used the PIC simulations alone. The delicate interplay between the conversion from the electromagnetic field energy to the longitudinal electrostatic fields results in the dispersion and so the red-shift of the pump laser pulse. We also studied the interaction of the dispersed pulse (after the propagation in underdense plasma) with the sub-wavelength two-layer composite target. The ions from the thin, low-density second layer are found to be efficiently accelerated to ∼ 70 MeV, which is not found to be the case without dispersion.},

The potential of this source for medical imaging was demonstrated by performing micro-computed tomography of a human femoral trabecular bone sample, allowing full 3D reconstruction to a resolution below 50 $\mu$m. The use of a 1 cm long wakefield accelerator means that the length of the beamline (excluding the laser) is dominated by the x-ray imaging distances rather than the electron acceleration distances. The source possesses high peak brightness, which allows each image to be recorded with a single exposure and reduces the time required for a full tomographic scan. These properties make this an interesting laboratory source for many tomographic imaging applications.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.A laser-wakefield driven x-ray source is used for the radiography of human bone. The betatron motion of accelerated electrons generates x-rays which are hard (critical energy Ecrit {\textless}30 keV), have small source size ({\textless}3 $\mu$m) and high average brightness. The x-rays are generated from a helium gas cell which is near-instantly replenishable, and thus the average photon flux is limited by the repetition rate of the driving laser rather than the breakdown of the x-ray source. A tomograph of a human bone sample was recorded with a resolution down to 50 $\mu$m. The photon flux was sufficiently high that a radiograph could be taken with each laser shot, and the fact that x-ray beams were produced on 97{\%} of shots minimised failed shots and facilitated full micro-computed tomography in a reasonable time scale of several hours, limited only by the laser repetition rate. The x-ray imaging beamline length (not including the laser) is shorter than that of a synchrotron source due to the high accelerating fields and small source size. Hence this interesting laboratory-based source may one day bridge the gap between small microfocus x-ray tubes and large synchrotron facilities.},

abstract = {High-resolution microcomputed tomography with benchtop X-ray sources requires long scan times because of the heat load limitation on the anode. We present an alternative, high-brightness plasma-based X-ray source that does not suffer from this restriction. A demonstration of tomography of a centimeter-scale complex organism achieves equivalent quality to a commercial scanner. We will soon be able to record such scans in minutes, rather than the hours required by conventional X-ray tubes. In the field of X-ray microcomputed tomography ($\mu$CT) there is a growing need to reduce acquisition times at high spatial resolution (approximate micrometers) to facilitate in vivo and high-throughput operations. The state of the art represented by synchrotron light sources is not practical for certain applications, and therefore the development of high-brightness laboratory-scale sources is crucial. We present here imaging of a fixed embryonic mouse sample using a compact laser–plasma-based X-ray light source and compare the results to images obtained using a commercial X-ray $\mu$CT scanner. The radiation is generated by the betatron motion of electrons inside a dilute and transient plasma, which circumvents the flux limitations imposed by the solid or liquid anodes used in conventional electron-impact X-ray tubes. This X-ray source is pulsed (duration {\textless}30 fs), bright ({\textgreater}1010 photons per pulse), small (diameter {\textless}1 $\mu$m), and has a critical energy {\textgreater}15 keV. Stable X-ray performance enabled tomographic imaging of equivalent quality to that of the $\mu$CT scanner, an important confirmation of the suitability of the laser-driven source for applications. The X-ray flux achievable with this approach scales with the laser repetition rate without compromising the source size, which will allow the recording of high-resolution $\mu$CT scans in minutes.},

abstract = {Electrical breakdown sets a limit on the kinetic energy that part- icles in a conventional radio-frequency accelerator can reach. New accelerator concepts must be developed to achieve higher energies and to make future particle colliders more compact and affordable. The plasma wakefield accelerator (PWFA) embodies one such con- cept, in which the electric field of a plasma wake excited by a bunch of charged particles (such as electrons) is used to accelerate a trail- ing bunch of particles. To apply plasma acceleration to electron– positron colliders, it is imperative that both the electrons and their antimatter counterpart, the positrons, are efficiently accelerated at high fields using plasmas1 . Although substantial progress has recently been reported on high-field, high-efficiency acceleration of electrons in a PWFA powered by an electron bunch2 , such an electron-driven wake is unsuitable for the acceleration and focus- ing of a positron bunch. Here we demonstrate a new regime of PWFAs where particles in the front of a single positron bunch transfer their energy to a substantial number of those in the rear of the same bunch by exciting a wakefield in the plasma. In the process, the accelerating field is altered—‘self-loaded'—so that about a billion positrons gain five gigaelectronvolts of energy with a narrow energy spread over a distance of just 1.3 metres. They extract about 30 per cent of the wake's energy and forma spectrally distinct bunch with a root-mean-square energy spread as low as},

abstract = {Betatron x-ray emission in laser plasma accelerators is a promising compact source that may be an alternative to conventional x-ray sources, based on large scale machines. In addition to its potential as a source, precise measurements of betatron emission can reveal crucial information about relativistic laser–plasma interaction. We show that the emission length and the position of the x-ray emission can be obtained by placing an aperture mask close to the source, and by measuring the beam profile of the betatron x-ray radiation far from the aperture mask. The position of the x-ray emission gives information on plasma wave breaking and hence on the laser non-linear propagation. Moreover, the measurement of the longitudinal extension helps one to determine whether the acceleration is limited by pump depletion or dephasing effects. In the case of multiple injections, it is used to retrieve unambiguously the position in the plasma of each injection. This technique is also used to study how, in a capillary discharge, the variations of the delay between the discharge and the laser pulse affect the interaction. The study reveals that, for a delay appropriate for laser guiding, the x-ray emission only occurs in the second half of the capillary: no electrons are injected and accelerated in the first half.},

abstract = {Relativistic interaction of short-pulse lasers with underdense plasmas has recently led to the emergence of a novel generation of femtosecond x-ray sources. Based on radiation from electrons accelerated in plasma, these sources have the common properties to be compact and to deliver collimated, incoherent and femtosecond radiation. In this article we review, within a unified formalism, the betatron radiation of trapped and accelerated electrons in the so-called bubble regime, the synchrotron radiation of laser-accelerated electrons in usual meter-scale undulators, the nonlinear Thomson scattering from relativistic electrons oscillating in an intense laser field, and the Thomson backscattered radiation of a laser beam by laser-accelerated electrons. The underlying physics is presented using ideal models, the relevant parameters are defined, and analytical expressions providing the features of the sources are given. Numerical simulations and a summary of recent experimental results on the different mechanisms are also presented. Each section ends with the foreseen development of each scheme. Finally, one of the most promising applications of laser-plasma accelerators is discussed: the realization of a compact free-electron laser in the x-ray range of the spectrum. In the conclusion, the relevant parameters characterizing each sources are summarized. Considering typical laser-plasma interaction parameters obtained with currently available lasers, examples of the source features are given. The sources are then compared to each other in order to define their field of applications.},

abstract = {Laser-plasma accelerators can produce high-quality electron beams, up to giga electronvolts in energy, from a centimetre scale device. The properties of the electron beams and the accelerator stability are largely determined by the injection stage of electrons into the accelerator. The simplest mechanism of injection is self-injection, in which the wakefield is strong enough to trap cold plasma electrons into the laser wake. The main drawback of this method is its lack of shot-to-shot stability. Here we present experimental and numerical results that demonstrate the existence of two different self-injection mechanisms. Transverse self-injection is shown to lead to low stability and poor-quality electron beams, because of a strong dependence on the intensity profile of the laser pulse. In contrast, longitudinal injection, which is unambiguously observed for the first time, is shown to lead to much more stable acceleration and higher-quality electron beams.},

abstract = {Laser-plasma wakefield accelerators have seen tremendous progress, now capable of pro- ducing quasi-monoenergetic electron beams in the GeV energy range with few-femtoseconds bunch duration. Scaling these accelerators to the nanocoulomb range would yield hundreds of kiloamperes peak current and stimulate the next generation of radiation sources covering high-field THz, high-brightness X-ray and $\gamma$-ray sources, compact free-electron lasers and laboratory-size beam-driven plasma accelerators. However, accelerators generating such currents operate in the beam loading regime where the accelerating field is strongly modified by the self-fields of the injected bunch, potentially deteriorating key beam parameters. Here we demonstrate that, if appropriately controlled, the beam loading effect can be employed to improve the accelerator's performance. Self-truncated ionization injection enables loading of unprecedented charges of ∼0.5 nC within a mono-energetic peak. As the energy balance is reached, we show that the accelerator operates at the theoretically predicted optimal loading condition and the final energy spread is minimized.},

abstract = {We revisit the description of inverse Compton scattering sources and the photon beams generated therein, emphasizing the behavior of their phase space density distributions and how they depend upon those of the two colliding beams of electrons and photons. Main objective is to provide practical formulas for bandwidth, spectral density, brilliance, which are valid in general for any value of the recoil factor, i.e. both in the Thomson regime of negligible electron recoil, and in the deep Compton recoil dominated region, which is of interest for gamma-gamma colliders and Compton Sources for the production of multi-GeV photon beams. We adopt a description based on the center of mass reference system of the electron-photon collision, in order to underline the role of the electron recoil and how it controls the relativistic Doppler/boost effect in various regimes. Comparisons with Monte Carlo simulations of inverse Compton scattering in various scenarios are presented, showing very good agreement with the analytical formulas: in particular we find that the bandwidth dependence on the electron beam emittance, of paramount importance in Thomson regime, as it limits the amount of focusing imparted to the electron beam, becomes much less sensitive in deep Compton regime, allowing a stronger focusing of the electron beam to enhance luminosity without loss of mono-chromaticity. A similar effect occurs concerning the bandwidth dependence on the frequency spread of the incident photons: in deep recoil regime the bandwidth comes out to be much less dependent on the frequency spread.},

Biological systems are able to have multiple traits evolving concurrently to adapt to their environment. For many years, evolutionary algorithms have been successfully used on cellular automata (CA) to produce performant update functions. The resulting CAs are, however, much slower and more sensitive to perturbations than CAs with an evolved topology and fixed uniform update rule. Unfortunately, these are not nearly as performant, and suffer from scaling up the number of cells. We propose a hybrid paradigm that simultaneously coevolves the supporting network and the update functions of CAs. The resulting systems combine the high performance of the update evolution and the robustness properties and speed of the topology evolution CAs. Coevolution in CAs a viable tradeoff between the two single trait evolutions.},

Methods to precisely characterize the temporal-spectral state of light at the single-photon level thus play a central role in understanding quantum emitters and are a key requirement for quantum technologies that harness single-photon states. Here we demonstrate an optical reference-free method, which melds techniques from ultrafast metrology and single-photon spectral detection, to characterize the temporal-spectral state of single photons. This provides a robust, wavelength-tunable approach for rapid characterization of pulsed single-photon states that underpins emerging optical quantum technologies based upon the temporal-spectral mode structure of quantum light.},

abstract = {A one‐dimensional plasma model consisting of a large number of identical charge sheets embedded in a uniform fixed neutralizing background is investigated by following the sheet motions on a high‐speed computer. The thermalizing properties and ergodic behavior of the system are examined and found to be in agreement with the assumption that one is equally likely to find the system in equal volumes of the available phase space. The velocity distribution, Debye shielding, drag on fast and slow sheets, diffusion in velocity space, the Landau damping of the Fourier modes, the amplitude distribution function for the Fourier modes, and the distribution of electric fields felt by the sheets were obtained for the plasma in thermal equilibrium and compared with theoretically predicted values. In every case, except one, the drag on a slow sheet, the numerical results agreed with theory to within the statistical accuracy of the results. The numerical results for the drag on a slow sheet were about a factor of 2 lower than the theory predicated indicating that the approximations made in the theory are not entirely valid. An understanding of the cause of the discrepancy might lead to a better understanding of collisional processes in plasmas.},

abstract = {Investigations of nonlinear electron oscillations in a cold plasma where the thermal motions may be neglected indicate that except for the simplest one-dimensional situation such oscillations will destroy themselves through the development of multistream flow. It is found possible to give an exact analysis of oscillations with plane, cylindrical, and spherical symmetry. Plane oscillations in a uniform plasma are found to be stable below a critical amplitude. For larger amplitudes it is found that multistream flow or fine-scale mixing sets in on the first oscillation. Oscillations with spherical or cylindrical symmetry develop multistream flow almost always, independent of the amplitude. The time required for mixing to start is inversely proportional to the square of the amplitude. Plane oscillations in a nonuniform plasma are also found to exhibit this type of behavior. Some considerations are also given to more general oscillations and a calculation is presented which indicates that multistream flow will usually set in.},

We propose a theoretical model for the description of beamstrahlung radiation and pair creation which occur at these interaction points. The model is confirmed by full-scale 3D self-consistent particle-in-cell simulations that include quantum electrodynamics effects. At the threshold of the quantum regime, the yield of secondary pairs is orders of magnitude higher than what is predicted by previous studies, based on the average field approximation. This yield is relevant to near-term laser wakefield (LWFA) experiments and for the design of future TeV colliders based on plasma acceleration.},

This channel generates relativistic electron-positron jets more than three orders of magnitude denser than has so far been possible. We find that the process is so efficient that it leads to the prolific production of heavier pairs as well. The jets produced by this new channel will enable the study of collective processes in relativistic electron-positron plasmas.},

abstract = {The field of laser-matter interaction traditionally deals with the response of atoms, molecules and plasmas to an external light wave. However, the recent sustained technological progress is opening up the possibility of employing intense laser radiation to trigger or substantially influence physical processes beyond atomic-physics energy scales. Available optical laser intensities exceeding {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}22{\}}\backslash;\backslashtext{\{}W/cm{\$}{\^{}}2{\$}{\}}{\$} can push the fundamental light-electron interaction to the extreme limit where radiation-reaction effects dominate the electron dynamics, can shed light on the structure of the quantum vacuum, and can trigger the creation of particles like electrons, muons and pions and their corresponding antiparticles. Also, novel sources of intense coherent high-energy photons and laser-based particle colliders can pave the way to nuclear quantum optics and may even allow for potential discovery of new particles beyond the Standard Model. These are the main topics of the present article, which is devoted to a review of recent investigations on high-energy processes within the realm of relativistic quantum dynamics, quantum electrodynamics, nuclear and particle physics, occurring in extremely intense laser fields.},

In particular, we derive analytically the asymptotic behavior of the emission probability per unit of photon light-cone energy k − and show that it tends to a constant for k − → 0. With numerical codes being an essential tool for the interpretation of present and upcoming experiments in strong-field QED, we obtained an improved approximation for the photon emission probability, implemented it numerically, and showed that it amends the inaccurate behavior of the LCFA in the infrared region, such that it is in qualitative and good quantitative agreement with the full strong-field QED probability also in the infrared region.},

In our previous work [Phys.{\~{}}Rev.{\~{}}A{\~{}}$\backslash$textbf{\{}98{\}}, 012134 (2018)] we have analyzed the shortcomings of the LCFA in nonlinear Compton scattering for the case of a background plane-wave field.

In addition, we provide an explicit and simple implementation of an improved expression of the nonlinear Compton scattering differential probability that solves the main shortcomings of the standard LCFA, and is suitable for background electromagnetic fields with arbitrary spacetime structure such as those of particle-in-cell (PIC) codes. Finally, we carry out a systematic procedure to calculate the probability of nonlinear Compton scattering per unit of emitted photon light-cone energy and of nonlinear Breit-Wheeler pair production per unit of produced positron light-cone energy beyond the LCFA in a plane-wave background field, which allows us to identify the limits of validity of this approximation quantitatively.},

The method is a hybrid in that rotational invariance is approximately restored prior to variation and then fully restored before the mixing of intrinsic states. We discuss such features of Ge73 as shape coexistence and triaxiality, and their effects on spin-dependent neutralino cross sections. Our calculations yield a satisfactory quadrupole moment and an accurate magnetic moment in this very complicated nucleus, suggesting that the spin structure and thus the axial--vector response to dark matter particles is modeled well.},

abstract = {High order harmonic generation (HHG) produced by the interaction of an intense laser pulse and a gas medium can provide a table top scale coherent radiation source in the short wavelength range from the ultraviolet to the soft x-ray region. The high order harmonics which are emitted in a series of attosecond bursts with high spatial and temporal coherence are very interesting for time-resolved spectroscopy and imaging applications. This dissertation reports experimental work based on the HHG technique. We present two novel schemes which can be used to enhance the quality of the HHG source including the conversion efficiency, the coherence and the cut-off photon energy. In order to achieve this goal, we focus our studies on the phase matching of the nonlinear conversion process which is the main limitation to the quality of the HHG source. In the first scheme, a combination of lens and axicon is used to create a Bessel Gaussian beam instead of only a Gaussian beam and the presence of a new geometrical phase mismatch term is demonstrated. This allows us to compensate for the phase mismatch and thus to enhance the phase matching condition. By using this configuration, a higher photon flux and an improved spatial beam profile of the harmonics in the cut-off region are achieved. In the second scheme, the phase matching is controlled by a means of an off-axis beam. When the phase mismatch is varied, mainly due to a change in the dipole phase term, the harmonic emission can be destroyed or enhanced. This technique provides the possibility to generate very high harmonic photon energies. In our experiment, for HHG from a semi-infinite helium filled gas cell, the harmonic signal of wavelength less than 8 nm is strongly enhanced compared with that emitted in a traditional semi-infinite interaction geometry, i.e., without the off-axis beam, and a low photon flux signal with wavelength of {\~{}} 5.5 nm is observed. This dissertation also investigates the influence of the driving laser on the harmonic spectral features to reveal the role of macroscopic propagation effects on the HHG process as well as the interplay between the single-atom response and the macroscopic response. We demonstrate the change of the harmonic spectrum when the phase of the fundamental field is varied by controlling the chirp of the laser. The laser intensity dependence of the harmonic generation is then studied for two cases: with confinement and without confinement of the ionization fraction. From these studies, the conditions for generating sharp and strong harmonics can be determined. The next part of this dissertation is devoted to two applications based on the high harmonic generation source. With the use of an off-axis beam, we conduct HHG experiments in a semi-finite gas cell filled with diatomic molecules (nitrogen and oxygen). Through investigation of the modulation of the HHG signal, we demonstrate the important role of phase matching on the harmonic emission from these molecules. This provides a new promising technique for studying the coherence dynamics of the ground states of molecules. An approach for employing harmonic emission for coherent diffractive imaging (CDI) is then presented. Our aim is to improve the spatial resolution of the reconstructed image by using the very short wavelength harmonic source as an illumination beam. Thus the generation of a harmonic source, based on helium gas, consisting of a few harmonics around 13.5 nm is successfully demonstrated and its spatial coherence is measured with the use of a Young's double slit. CDI experiments are carried out on two samples: a 2D regular array of pinholes and a conjugated polymer film.},

abstract = {The radiation reaction is expected to play a critical role in light-matter interactions at extreme intensity. Knowing key characteristic of this effect will enable its experimental detection and, most importantly, allow to investigate the causality of the electron self interaction with its radiated field. Exploiting the theoretical derivation and 2D PIC simulation, We demonstrate that electron reflection, enabled by the radiation reaction in a head-on collision with an intense laser pulse, can provide a distinct signature to differentiate the classical and quantum features. In classical regime, there is a precipitous threshold of laser intensity to achieve the whole electron bunch reflection. However, this threshold becomes a gradual transition in the quantum regime, where the electron bunch is quasi-isotropically scattered by the laser pulse and this process resembles a water splash.},

We observe stable, continuous ionization-induced injection of electrons into the wakefield for laser powers exceeding a threshold of 7 TW. The beam charge scales approximately linear with the laser energy and is limited by beam loading. For 40 TW laser pulses we measure a maximum charge of almost 1 nC per shot, originating mostly from electrons of less than 10 MeV energy.

abstract = {Technology based on high-peak-power lasers has the potential to provide compact and intense radiation sources for a wide range of innovative applications. In particular, electrons that are accelerated in the wakefield of an intense laser pulse oscillate around the propagation axis and emit X-rays. This betatron source, which essentially reproduces the principle of a synchrotron at the millimeter scale, provides bright radiation with femtosecond duration and high spatial coherence. However, despite its unique features, the usability of the betatron source has been constrained by its poor control and stability. In this article, we demon-strate the reliable production of X-ray beams with tunable polarization. Using ionization-induced injection in a gas mixture, the orbits of the relativistic electrons emitting the radiation are reproducible and controlled. We observe that both the signal and beam profile fluctuations are significantly reduced and that the beam pointing varies by less than a tenth of the beam diver-gence. The polarization ratio reaches 80{\%}, and the polarization axis can easily be rotated. We anticipate a broad impact of the source, as its unprecedented performance opens the way for new applications.},

@article{Downer2018,
abstract = {Plasma-based accelerators that impart energy gain as high as several GeV to electrons or positrons within a few centimeters have engendered a new class of diagnostic techniques very different from those used in connection with conventional radio-frequency (rf) accelerators. The need for new diagnostics stems from the micrometer scale and transient, dynamic structure of plasma accelerators, which contrasts with the meter scale and static structure of conventional accelerators. Because of this micrometer source size, plasma-accelerated electron bunches can emerge with smaller normalized transverse emittance (ϵ n {\textless} 0.1 mm mrad) and shorter duration ($\tau$ b ∼ 1 fs) than bunches from rf linacs. Single-shot diagnostics are reviewed that determine such small ϵ n and $\tau$ b noninvasively and with high resolution from wide-bandwidth spectral measurement of electromagnetic radiation the electrons emit: ϵ n from x rays emitted as electrons interact with transverse internal fields of the plasma accelerator or with external optical fields or undulators; $\tau$ b from THz to optical coherent transition radiation emitted upon traversing interfaces. The duration of ∼1 fs bunches can also be measured by sampling individual cycles of a copropagating optical pulse or by measuring the associated magnetic field using a transverse probe pulse. Because of their luminal velocity and micrometer size, the evolving structure of plasma accelerators, the key determinant of accelerator performance, is exceptionally challenging to visualize in the laboratory. Here a new generation of laboratory diagnostics is reviewed that yield snapshots, or even movies, of laser-and particle-beam-generated plasma accelerator structures based on their phase modulation or deflection of femtosecond electromagnetic or electron probe pulses. Spatiotemporal resolution limits of these imaging techniques are discussed, along with insight into plasma-based acceleration physics that has emerged from analyzing the images and comparing them to simulated plasma structures.},

Two symmetric electron beams, generated by photocathodes and accelerated in linacs, produce two gamma ray beams through Compton back scattering with two J-class lasers. Tuning the system energy above the Breit-Wheeler cross section threshold, a flux of electron-positron pairs is generated out of light-light interaction.

The reason is very general and is due to the quantum self-destruction of the coherent state because of the scattering of constituent graviton quanta. This process creates an irreversible quantum clock, which precludes eternal de Sitter. It also eliminates the possibility of Boltzmann brains and Poincare recurrences. This effect is expected to be part of any microscopic theory that takes into account the quantum corpuscular structure of the cosmological background. This observation puts the cosmological constant problem in a very different light, promoting it, from a naturalness problem, into a question of quantum consistency. We are learning that quantum gravity cannot tolerate exceedingly-classical sources.},

@techreport{Eardley,
abstract = {Introduction Clustered gases are a very interesting target in laser-plasma physics due to their ability to very efficiently absorb short pulse laser energy; this can be as high as 95{\%} [1]. This makes clustered gases excellent x-ray sources, as large amounts of energy absorbed produces a high temperature plasma leading to bright x-ray emission [2]. This report will describe a recent experiment in Gemini TA2 in which the effect of the temporal shape of a laser pulse on x-ray emission from a clustered gas target was explored, and the optimum pulse shape that yielded the highest x-ray emission was found. A genetic algorithm was used to find this optimum pulse shape, a technique enabled by operation of the beam line at 5Hz, allowing for rapid averaging of large data sets. Genetic algorithms are a useful tool for exploring large and multidimensional parameter spaces. The optimization of a result based on the variation of a single parameter is achievable with a simple parameter scan. However, scanning a multidimensional parameter space would require taking a large data set and be very time consuming. A genetic algorithm averts this problem as it does not require every possible point in the parameter space to be tested. In this experiment a three-dimensional parameter space was explored, these were the second, third and fourth order spectral phase terms of the laser. Changing these properties of the laser pulse allows the direct manipulation of the pulse shape in time. Method The optimization routine was performed using the front end of the Gemini laser at the Central Laser Facility. The laser delivered pulses of 150mJ to an argon gas target that was allowed to cluster as it expanded from the gas jet into the vacuum chamber. The gas jet was backed with a pressure of 30bar. Using the Hagena parameter [3] the average cluster size was estimated to be 14nm containing {\~{}}10 5 atoms with an internal cluster density {\~{}}10 22 atoms cm-3. The laser is capable of operating at 5Hz, therefore it can quickly gather large volumes of data for averaging. This was very important for the optimization as variation between shots can be very large in laser plasma interactions. The laser's pulse shape was manipulated using the Dazzler, which is an acousto-optic dispersion filter, that could be directly controlled by the genetic algorithm code. The x-ray yield was measured using silicon PIN diodes, sensitive to x-rays with energy in the range 2-20 keV.},

abstract = {A comprehensive theory is developed to describe the nonlinear Thomson scattering of intense laser fields from beams and plasmas. This theory is valid for linearly or circularly polarized incident laser fields of arbitrary intensities and for electrons of arbitrary energies. Explicit expressions for the intensity distributions of the scattered radiation are calculated and numerically evlauated. The space-charge electrostatic potential, which is important in high-density plasmas and prevents the axial drift of electrons, is included self-consistently. Various properties of the scattered radiation are examined, including the linewidth, angular distribution, and the behavior of the radiation spectra at ultrahigh intensities. Nonideal effects, such as electron-energy spread and beam emittance, are discussed. A laser synchrotron source (LSS), based on nonlinear Thomson scattering, may provide a practical method for generating tunable, near-monochromatic, well-collimated, short-pulse x rays in a compact, relatively inexpensive source. Two examples of possible LSS configurations are presented: an electron-beam LSS generating hard (30-keV, 0.4-angstrom) x rays and a plasma LSS generating soft (0.3-keV, 40-angstrom) x rays.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The study of structure, thermodynamic state, equation of state (EOS) and transport properties of warm dense matter (WDM) has become one of the key aspects of laboratory astrophysics. This field has demonstrated its importance not only concerning the internal structure of planets, but also other astrophysical bodies such as brown dwarfs, crusts of old stars or white dwarf stars. There has been a rapid increase in interest and activity in this field over the last two decades owing to many technological advances including not only the commissioning of high energy optical laser systems, z-pinches and X-ray free electron lasers, but also short-pulse laser facilities capable of generation of novel particle and X-ray sources. Many new diagnostic methods have been developed recently to study WDM in its full complexity. Even ultrafast nonequilibrium dynamics has been accessed for the first time thanks to subpicosecond laser pulses achieved at new facilities. Recent years saw a number of major discoveries with direct implications to astrophysics such as the formation of diamond at pressures relevant to interiors of frozen giant planets like Neptune, metallic hydrogen under conditions such as those found inside Jupiter's dynamo or formation of lonsdaleite crystals under extreme pressures during asteroid impacts on celestial bodies. This paper provides a broad review of the most recent experimental work carried out in this field with a special focus on the methods used. All typical schemes used to produce WDM are discussed in detail. Most of the diagnostic techniques recently established to probe WDM are also described. This paper also provides an overview of the most prominent examples of these methods used in experiments. Even though the main emphasis of the publication is experimental work focused on laboratory astrophysics primarily at laser facilities, a brief outline of other methods such as dynamic compression with z-pinches and static compression using diamond anvil cells (DAC) is also included. Some relevant theoretical and computational efforts related to WDM and astrophysics are mentioned in this review.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {In a forced laser-wakefield accelerator experiment (Malka et al 2002 Science 298 1596) where the length of the pump laser pulse is a few plasma periods long, the leading edge of the laser pulse undergoes frequency downshifting and head erosion as the laser energy is transferred to the wake. Therefore, after some propagation distance, the group velocity of the leading edge of the pump pulse—and thus of the driven electron plasma wave—will slow down. This can have implications for the dephasing length of the accelerated electrons and therefore needs to be understood experimentally. We have carried out an experimental investigation where we have measured the velocity v f of the 'wave-front' of the plasma wave driven by a nominally 50 fs (full width half maximum), intense ( a 0 {\#}{\#}IMG{\#}{\#} [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sime.gif] {\{}sime{\}} 1), 0.815 µm laser pulse. To determine the speed of the wave front, time- and space-resolved refractometry, interferometry and Thomson scattering were used. Although a laser pulse propagating through a relatively low-density plasma ( n e = 1.3 × 10 19 cm −3 ) showed no measurable changes in v f over 1.3 mm (and no accelerated electrons), a high-density plasma ( n e = 5 × 10 19 cm −3 ) generated accelerated electrons and showed a continuous change in v f as the laser pulse propagated through the plasma. Possible causes and consequences of the observed v f evolution are discussed.},

abstract = {Particle accelerators are used in a wide variety of fields, ranging from medicine and biology to high-energy physics. The accelerating fields in conventional accelerators are limited to a few tens of MeV m(-1), owing to material breakdown at the walls of the structure. Thus, the production of energetic particle beams currently requires large-scale accelerators and expensive infrastructures. Laser-plasma accelerators have been proposed as a next generation of compact accelerators because of the huge electric fields they can sustain ({\textgreater}100 GeV m(-1)). However, it has been difficult to use them efficiently for applications because they have produced poor-quality particle beams with large energy spreads, owing to a randomization of electrons in phase space. Here we demonstrate that this randomization can be suppressed and that the quality of the electron beams can be dramatically enhanced. Within a length of 3 mm, the laser drives a plasma bubble that traps and accelerates plasma electrons. The resulting electron beam is extremely collimated and quasi-monoenergetic, with a high charge of 0.5 nC at 170 MeV.},

In the experiment, two laser pulses are used; the main laser pulse drives a wakefield, while a second countercrossing laser beam produces a plasma whose expansion creates a channel with significant density gradients. Local injection of electrons in the wakefield is triggered by wave breaking in the density ramp. The injection is localized spatially and leads to the generation of collimated and narrow energy spread relativistic electron beams at the 100 MeV level, with charges in the range of 20–100 pC. The stability of this injection process is compared to the stability of the colliding pulse injection process and is found to be inferior for our experimental conditions. On the other hand, it is found that as the electron beam divergence is smaller in the case of gradient injection, the transverse emittance might be better.},

abstract = {In laser-plasma-based accelerators, an intense laser pulse drives a large electric field (the wakefield) which accelerates particles to high energies in distances much shorter than in conventional accelerators. These high acceleration gradients, of a few hundreds of gigavolts per metre, hold the promise of compact high-energy particle accelerators. Recently, several experiments have shown that laser-plasma accelerators can produce high-quality electron beams, with quasi-monoenergetic energy distributions at the 100 MeV level. However, these beams do not have the stability and reproducibility that are required for applications. This is because the mechanism responsible for injecting electrons into the wakefield is based on highly nonlinear phenomena, and is therefore hard to control. Here we demonstrate that the injection and subsequent acceleration of electrons can be controlled by using a second laser pulse. The collision of the two laser pulses provides a pre-acceleration stage which provokes the injection of electrons into the wakefield. The experimental results show that the electron beams obtained in this manner are collimated (5 mrad divergence), monoenergetic (with energy spread {\textless}10 per cent), tuneable (between 15 and 250 MeV) and, most importantly, stable. In addition, the experimental observations are compatible with electron bunch durations shorter than 10 fs. We anticipate that this stable and compact electron source will have a strong impact on applications requiring short bunches, such as the femtolysis of water, or high stability, such as radiotherapy with high-energy electrons or radiography for materials science.},

abstract = {Ultra-fast synchrotron radiation emission can arise from the transverse betatron motion of an electron in a laser plasma wakefield, and the radiation spectral peak is limited to tens of keV. Here, we present a new method for achieving high-energy radiation via accelerated electrons wiggling in an additional laser field whose intensity is one order of magnitude higher than that for the self-generated transverse field of the bubble, resulting in an equivalent wiggler strength parameter K increase of approximately twenty times. By calculating synchrotron radiation, we acquired a peak brightness for the case of the laser wiggler field of 1.2 × 10 23 ph/s/mrad 2 /mm 2 /0.1{\%}BW at 1 MeV. Such a high brilliance and ultra-fast gamma-ray source could be applied to time-resolved probing of dense materials and the production of medical radioisotopes. Ultra-fast X-/$\gamma$-ray sources have been widely used to resolve the structure and dynamics of dense matter and biological proteins 1,2. However, these sources with high brightness are mainly achieved at large facilities, such as X-ray free electron laser (X-FEL) 3 and synchrotron radiation light sources 4 , which are accessible to a limited number of users. Both of these sources consist of a series of electron acceleration RF cavities with a maximum electrical breakdown field of approximately 100 MV/m and a periodic magnetic structure that forces the electrons to oscillate and emit radiation. In contrast, laser-driven plasma accelerators can generate one thousand times larger acceleration gradients 5-7 , thus reducing a hundred metre synchrotron facility to a few centimetres 8,9. Laser wakefield accelerators (LWFAs) have become increasingly mature and have recently exhibited stability 10 , energy tunability 11,12 , femtosecond durations 13 , and low divergence (mrad) 14 electron bunches with a charge at the pC level 15,16. When a fraction of background electrons is captured by the electrostatic fields produced by the separation of electrons and ions inside the cavity, these electrons can be accelerated by the longitudinal electric wakefield and undergo transverse oscillations in the ion cavity. The oscillation occurs at the betatron frequency $\omega$ $\omega$ $\gamma$ = $\beta$ / 2 pe},

However, the scope of the betatron sources is limited by a low energy efficiency and a photon energy in the 10's of kiloelectronvolt range, which for example prohibits the use of these sources for probing dense matter. Here, based on three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we propose an original hybrid scheme that combines a low-density laser-driven plasma accelerator with a high-density beam-driven plasma radiator, and thereby considerably increases the photon energy and the radiated energy of the betatron source. The energy efficiency is also greatly improved, with about 1{\%} of the laser energy transferred to the radiation, and the gamma-ray photon energy exceeds the megaelectronvolt range when using a 15 J laser pulse. This high-brilliance hybrid betatron source opens the way to a wide range of applications requiring MeV photons, such as the production of medical isotopes with photo-nuclear reactions, radiography of dense objects in the defense or industrial domains and imaging in nuclear physics.},

abstract = {Laser wakefield acceleration of electrons usually offers an axisymmetry around the laser propagation axis. Thus, the accelerating electrons that are focused on axis often execute small transverse oscillations. In this Article, we propose a simple scheme to break this symmetry, which enhances the transverse wiggling of electrons and boosts the betatron radiation emission. Through 3D particle-in-cell simulations, we show that sending the laser with a small angle of incidence on a transverse plasma density gradient generates an asymmetric wakefield. It first provokes injection and then increases the wiggling of the electrons through the transverse shifting of the wakefield axis which occurs when the laser pulse leaves the gradient. Consequently, we show that the radiated energy per unit of charge can increase by a factor {\textgreater} 20 when using this scheme, and that the critical energy of the radiation quintuples compared with a reference case without the transverse density gradient.},

abstract = {Betatron X-ray radiation in laser-plasma accelerators is produced when electrons are accelerated and wiggled in the laser-wakefield cavity. This femtosecond source, producing intense X-ray beams in the multi kiloelectronvolt range has been observed at different interaction regime using high power laser from 10 to 100 TW. However, none of the spectral measurement performed were at sufficient resolution, bandwidth and signal to noise ratio to precisely determine the shape of spectra with a single laser shot in order to avoid shot to shot fluctuations. In this letter, the Betatron radiation produced using a 80 TW laser is characterized by using a single photon counting method. We measure in single shot spectra from 8 to 21 keV with a resolution better than 350 eV. The results obtained are in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions and demonstrate the synchrotron type nature of this radiation mechanism. The critical energy is found to be Ec = 5.6 ± 1 keV for our experimental conditions. In addition, the features of the source at this energy range open novel perspectives for applications in time-resolved X-ray science. A femtosecond X-ray beam, called Betatron, can be produced by focusing an intense femtosecond laser pulse at relativistic intensities, on the order of 10 18 − 10 19 W.cm −2 , onto a gas jet target. Interacting with the quasi-instantaneously created under-dense plasma, the laser pulse excites a wakefield in which electrons can be trapped and accelerated to high energies in short distances [1–5]. These electrons perform Beta-tron oscillations across the propagation axis, and emit X-ray photons [6–10] (radiation from accelerating charged-particles). The Betatron radiation consists on a broad-band X-ray beam, collimated within 10's mrad, with a femtosecond duration [11].},

ABSTRACT An advanced focusing scheme, called a "flying focus," uses a chromatic focusing system combined with a broadband laser pulse with its colors arranged in time to propagate a high intensity focus over a distance that can be much greater than its Rayleigh length while decoupling the speed at which the peak intensity propagates from its group velocity. The flying focus generates a short effective pulse duration with a small diameter focal spot that co-or counter-propagates along the optical axis at any velocity. Experiments validating the concept measured subluminal ({\`{A}}0.09c) to superluminal (39c) focal spot velocities with a nearly constant peak intensity over 4.5 mm. Experiments that increased the peak intensity above the ionization threshold for gas demonstrated ionization waves propagating at the velocity of the flying focus. These ionization waves of any velocity overcome several laser-plasma propagation issues, including ionization-induced refraction. The flying focus presents opportunities to overcome current fundamental limitations in laser-plasma amplifiers, laser wakefield accelerators, photon accelerators, and high-order frequency conversion.

abstract = {The motion and scattering of free electrons in ultra-intense electromagnetic fields is an area of interest in both fundamental and applied research [1]. Experiments can now test decades-old theories of electrodynamics as well as lead to the development of compact sources of hard x-rays, which have unique properties. Previous experiments have observed phenomena in the weakly relativistic case (a0 ≥ 1) [2,3]. In ultra-intense fields (a0 {\textgreater}{\textgreater}1), the anomalous electron trajectory is predicted to produce a spectrum characterized by the merging of multiple high-order harmonic generation into a continuum. This may also be viewed as the multiphoton Thomson scattering regime analogous to the wiggler regime of synchrotron light generation. Thus, the light produced reflects the electrons behavior in an ultra-intense lase field. We discuss the first experimental tests in the highly relativistic case (a0 = 15 {\textgreater}{\textgreater} 1). The experiment required the use of two laser pulses. The first pulse was used to generate 300 ± 10 MeV electron beams carrying 5± 2 pC of charge via laser wakefield acceleration. The second pulse was tightly focused with an f/2 off-axis-paraboloid to an intensity of 7×10 20 W/cm 2 , corresponding to an amplitude of the normalized vector potential a0{\~{}}15 and scattered off the electron beam. Distinct radiation patterns with elliptical spatial profile and a broadband x-ray spectrum extending beyond 20 MeV were observed, which are indicative of the anomalous electron motion in ultra-intense laser field and multiphoton scattering. Fig. 1: Layout of the experimental setup. Two laser pulses from the DIOCLES laser system are used, the first to generate a high-energy electron beam and the second to scatter of the electron beam and produce x-rays. The electron beam is imaged on a scintillator and x-rays are measured spatially using a voxelated CsI and spectrally using a Compton spectrometer. References [1] D. P.

The X-ray intensity reached 4[thinsp] [times] [thinsp]1020[thinsp]W[thinsp]cm-2, corresponding to an electric field well above the atomic unit of strength and within almost four orders of magnitude of the quantum-electrodynamic critical field. We measure a signal from solid beryllium that scales quadratically in intensity, consistent with simultaneous non-resonant two-photon scattering from nearly-free electrons. The high-energy photons show an anomalously large redshift that is incompatible with a free-electron approximation for the ground-state electron distribution, suggesting an enhanced nonlinearity for scattering at large momentum transfer.},

abstract = {The generation of X-rays and $\gamma$-rays based on synchrotron radiation from free electrons, emitted in magnet arrays such as undulators, forms the basis of much of modern X-ray science. This approach has the drawback of requiring very high energy, up to the multi-GeV-scale, electron beams, to obtain the required photon energy. Due to the limit in accelerating gradients in conventional particle accelerators, reaching high energy typically demands use of instruments exceeding 100's of meters in length. Compact, less costly, monochromatic X-ray sources based on very high field acceleration and very short period undulators, however, may revolutionize diverse advanced X-ray applications ranging from novel X-ray therapy techniques to active interrogation of sensitive materials, by making them accessible in cost and size. Such compactness may be obtained by an all-optical approach, which employs a laser-driven high gradient accelerator based on inverse free electron laser (IFEL), followed by a collision point for inverse Compton scattering (ICS), a scheme where a laser is used to provide undulator fields. We present an experimental proof-of-principle of this approach, where a TW-class CO2 laser pulse is split in two, with half used to accelerate a high quality electron beam up to 84 MeV through the IFEL interaction, and the other half acts as an electromagnetic undulator to generate up to 13 keV X-rays via ICS. These results demonstrate the feasibility of this scheme, which can be joined with other techniques such as laser recirculation to yield very compact, high brilliance photon sources, extending from the keV to MeV scale. Furthermore, use of the IFEL acceleration with the ICS interaction produces a train of very high intensity X-ray pulses, thus also permitting a unique tool that can be phase-locked to a laser pulse in frontier pump-probe experimental scenarios.},

Free-electron lasers provide this perspective as they deliver brilliant femtosecond X-ray pulses spanning a wide photon energy range, which is necessary to gather element-specific and chemical-state-selective information with femtosecond time resolution. The key challenge lies in synchronizing the free-electron lasers with separate optical lasers. We exploit the peak brilliance of the free-electron laser in Hamburg2, 3 (FLASH) and establish X-ray- pulse-induced transient changes of the optical reflectivity in GaAs as a powerful tool for X-ray/optical cross-correlation. This constitutes a breakthrough in the path towards recording a molecular movie and—equally importantly—opens up the field of femtosecond X-ray-induced dynamics, only accessible with high-brilliance X-ray free-electron lasers.},

abstract = {Laser-driven accelerators, in which particles are accelerated by the electric field of a plasma wave (the wakefield) driven by an intense laser, have demonstrated accelerating electric fields of hundreds of GV m(-1) (refs 1-3). These fields are thousands of times greater than those achievable in conventional radio-frequency accelerators, spurring interest in laser accelerators as compact next-generation sources of energetic electrons and radiation. To date, however, acceleration distances have been severely limited by the lack of a controllable method for extending the propagation distance of the focused laser pulse. The ensuing short acceleration distance results in low-energy beams with 100 per cent electron energy spread, which limits potential applications. Here we demonstrate a laser accelerator that produces electron beams with an energy spread of a few per cent, low emittance and increased energy (more than 10(9) electrons above 80 MeV). Our technique involves the use of a preformed plasma density channel to guide a relativistically intense laser, resulting in a longer propagation distance. The results open the way for compact and tunable high-brightness sources of electrons and radiation.},

abstract = {Near-monoenergetic photon sources at MeV energies offer improved sensitivity at greatly reduced dose for active interrogation, and new capabilities in treaty verification, nondestructive assay of spent nuclear fuel and emergency response. Thomson (also referred to as Compton) scattering sources are an established method to produce appropriate photon beams. Applications are however restricted by the size of the required high-energy electron linac, scattering (photon production) system, and shielding for disposal of the high energy electron beam. Laser-plasma accelerators (LPAs) produce GeV electron beams in centimeters, using the plasma wave driven by the radiation pressure of an intense laser. Recent LPA experiments are presented which have greatly improved beam quality and efficiency, rendering them appropriate for compact high-quality photon sources based on Thomson scattering. Designs for MeV photon sources utilizing the unique properties of LPAs are presented. It is shown that control of the scattering laser, including plasma guiding, can increase photon production efficiency. This reduces scattering laser size and/or electron beam current requirements to scale compatible with the LPA. Lastly, the plasma structure can decelerate the electron beam after photon production, reducing the size of shielding required for beam disposal. Together, these techniques provide a path to a compact photon source system.},

abstract = {The colliding between ultra-relativistic electrons and an ultra-intense laser pulse is a powerful approach to testify the physics in strong-field QED regime. By considering spin-dependent radiation-reaction during laser-electron collision we find anti-symmetric deflection of electrons with different spin states. We revealed that such deflection is induced by the non-zero work done by radiation-reaction force along field polarization-direction in a half-period of phase, which is larger for spin-anti-paralleled electrons and smaller for spin-paralleled electrons. The spin-projection on the magnetic field of an electron gets inversed in adjacent half-periods due to oscillating magnetic field and therefore the deflection due to spin-dependent radiation is accumulated rather than vanishing. The new mechanism provides an extra dimension to observe quantum radiation-reaction effect in the strong-field QED regime by measuring the anti-symmetric distribution. The rising laser intensity enables us of investigating the dynamics of electrons in intense field, e.g. in fast ignition fusion, laser-driven particle acceleration and bright X/gamma-ray sources. When laser intensity approaches 10 23 W/cm 2 electron dynamics is strongly coupled with photon radiation and consequent recoil effect, which is usually referred to as the radiation-reaction (RR) effect. Such phenomenon can be further enhanced by colliding the laser with high energy electrons where RR becomes dominant as the field strength in the rest frame of the electron is boosted by a factor of ∼ $\gamma$ (the gamma factor of a relativistic electron) [1]. In the QED perspective, when the spin state of an electron is considered it has been found out that the spin-anti-paralleled electron tends to radiate more energy than the spin-paralleled electron [2, 3]. In the radiation-reaction regime, spin-flip along with "quantum-jump" process were proposed to polarize an unpolarized electron beam in the collision with an elliptically polarized laser pulse, which is not possible for linearly polarized laser [4]. However, in cases where spin-flip rate is negligible , when passing through the oscillating laser field the spin projection on the magnetic field axis in the rest frame of electron oscillates with the field and the net contribution from spin is averaged to zero. Therefore it seems that no sign of spin-dependent dynamics would emerge in the laser-electron collision, considering that the Stern-Gerlach effect is too weak to play a role [5] (will be discussed later). In this article, we will show that when radiation-reaction is coupled with spin dynamics, spin-dependent radiation causes accumulative deflection of polarized electrons and causes inhomogeneous polarity after colliding laser with an unpolarized electron bunch. The distinctive spin-dependent signature in electron dynamics can be testified in the next-generation 10-100 PW laser facilities [6-11] to account for quantum RR in the strong-field QED regime, as the change of polarity provides a new degree of freedom in addition to gamma pho-ton emission [12], electron energy reduction [13, 14] and electron motion [15, 16]. To our knowledge the mechanism of the spin-dependent radiative deflection has not been revealed previously. We mimic the collision process via a QED Monte-Carlo (MC) modelling as well as the classical equation of motion. The radiation power for spin-paralleled/-anti-paralleled electrons was given in Ref. [2]. The theory for arbitrarily polarized electrons is further developed in Ref. [3]. For electron polarization vector of s in its rest frame, the radiation probability rate is [3] dP d$\delta$d$\psi$ = − $\alpha$ b Ai 1 (z) + g 2Ai ′ (z) z + s $\zeta$ $\delta$ Ai(z) √ z (1) where $\alpha$ is the fine structure constant, b = k {\textperiodcentered} p/m 2 c 2 , Ai(z) the Airy function, $\delta$ = k {\textperiodcentered} k ′ /k {\textperiodcentered} p, $\psi$ the laser phase, k, k ′ and p the four-momentum of laser, pho-ton and electron, z = [ $\delta$ (1−$\delta$)$\chi$e ] 2/3 , g = 1 + $\delta$ 2 /[2(1 − $\delta$)], $\chi$ e = e|F {\textperiodcentered} p|/m 3 c 4 , F the electromagnetic tensor, e the electron charge, the reduced Planck constant, m the electron mass at rest, c the speed of light and s $\zeta$ = s {\textperiodcentered} ˆ B rest , respectively. Her{\^{e}} B rest is the direction of the magnetic field in the electron's rest frame. The dependence on spin-orientation vanishes in the collision with a symmetric laser field. For spin-flip events, the radiation probability for dP flip /d$\delta$d$\psi$ and dP nonflip /d$\delta$d$\psi$ are given in Ref. [3] where the electron undergoes s → −s in a spin-flip process. We numerically solve the equation of motion dp/dt =},

In the cross-colliding geometry, when radiation-reaction (RR) force is interpreted by the classical Landau-Lifshitz equation, we found that there is a distinctive barrier that allows penetration of electrons at energies beyond the barrier and blocks those of lower energies. While in the QED perspective, electrons can be well reflected (transmit) in the regime where complete transmission (reflection) is allowed classically. The reflection (transmission) is guaranteed by the quantum nature of radiation but forbidden by classical description. This effect is accompanied by the blurring of the angular distribution for scattered electrons and becomes significant for laser intensities at {\$}2\backslashtimes10{\^{}}{\{}23{\}}\backslash \backslashmathrm{\{}W/cm{\^{}}2{\}}{\$} and electron energies of {\$}\backslashsim 10{\^{}}2\backslash \backslashmathrm{\{}MeV{\}}{\$}; thus could be measured in the up-coming 10-100PW laser facilities.

In addition to being accelerated by the plasma wakefield, the beam particles also experience strong transverse forces that may disrupt the beam quality. Hollow plasma channels have been proposed as a technique for generating accelerating fields without transverse forces. Here we demonstrate a method for creating an extended hollow plasma channel and measure the wakefields created by an ultrarelativistic positron beam as it propagates through the channel. The plasma channel is created by directing a high-intensity laser pulse with a spatially modulated profile into lithium vapour, which results in an annular region of ionization.

Our results show that by the use of nonlinear chirped pulse the longitudinal wakefield and focusing force is stronger than that of linear chirped pulse. It is indicated that quadratic nonlinear chirped pulses are globally much efficient than periodic nonlinear chirped pulses. Our calculations also predict that in nonlinear chirped pulse case, the overlap of focusing and accelerating regions is broader than that achieved in linear chirped pulse.},

This novel scheme is shown to produce stable, quasi-monoenergetic, and tunable electron beams. We show that optimal accelerator performance is achieved by systematic variation of five critical parameters. For the injection stage, we show that the amount of trapped charge is controlled by the gas density, composition, and laser power. For the acceleration stage, the gas density and the length of the jet are found to determine the final electron energy. This independent control over both the injection and acceleration processes enabled independent control over the charge and energy of the accelerated electron beam while preserving the quasi-monoenergetic character of the beam. We show that the charge and energy can be varied in the ranges of 2–45pC, and 50–450MeV, respectively. This robust and versatile electron accelerator will find application in the generation of high-brightness and controllable x-rays, and as the injector stage for more conventional devices.},

abstract = {The radiation reaction is expected to play a critical role in light-matter interactions at extreme intensity. Knowing key characteristic of this effect will enable its experimental detection and, most importantly, allow to investigate the causality of the electron self interaction with its radiated field. Exploiting the theoretical derivation and 2D PIC simulation, We demonstrate that electron reflection, enabled by the radiation reaction in a head-on collision with an intense laser pulse, can provide a distinct signature to differentiate the classical and quantum features. In classical regime, there is a precipitous threshold of laser intensity to achieve the whole electron bunch reflection. However, this threshold becomes a gradual transition in the quantum regime, where the electron bunch is quasi-isotropically scattered by the laser pulse and this process resembles a water splash.},

abstract = {A high-intensity laser beam propagating through a dense plasma drives a strong current that robustly sustains a strong quasi-static Mega Tesla-level azimuthal magnetic field. The transverse laser field efficiently accelerates electrons in the presence of such a field that confines the transverse motion and deflects the electrons in the forward direction, establishing the novel forward-sliding swing acceleration mechanism. Its advantage is a threshold rather than resonant behavior, accelerating electrons to high energies for sufficiently strong laser-driven currents. We study the electrons' dynamics by a simplified model analytically, specifically deriving simple relations between the current , the particles' initial transverse momenta and the laser's field strength classifying the energy gain. We confirm the model's predictions by numerical simulations, indicating Mega ampere-level threshold currents and energy gains two orders of magnitude higher than achievable without the magnetic field. Recent advancements in high-power laser technology [1, 2] have paved the way for multidisciplinary applications by enabling compact plasma-based sources of energetic particles, such as electrons [3], ions [4-6], positrons [7, 8], and neutrons [9], and radiation [10, 11], ranging from x-rays to hard gamma-rays. For these applications the energy transfer from the laser pulse to the plasma electrons is critically important, as once accelerated , they can drive secondary particle and radiation sources. The applications that prioritize the mono-energetic feature of the electron spectrum tend to rely on the laser-wakefield acceleration regime [3, 12], whereas the applications that prioritize the electron charge tend to rely on the direct laser acceleration (DLA) regime [13, 14]. The latter include bright, short-pulsed gamma-ray sources [15-20] that are necessary for advanced nuclear and radiological detection systems [21, 22]. The essence of DLA is an energy transfer from the laser electric field directly to the electrons. This can take place in a dense plasma without stringent density limitations [23, 24], which allows the laser to accelerate a large electron population. The regime can even be used to accelerate electrons in optically opaque plasmas if the laser is sufficiently intense to induce relativistic transparency [25, 26]. Typically, the accelerated electrons are pulled into the laser beam from the surrounding plasma with an initially transverse momentum. An electron with initial momentum p i m e c can gain an energy $\epsilon$ 0 = $\gamma$ 0 m e c 2 , where $\gamma$ 0 ≈ (a 2 0 /2)(m e c/p i), from a plane wave with intensity I 0 and normalized amplitude a 0 ≈ 0.85I 0 [10 18 W/cm 2 ] 1/2 $\lambda$[µm] where $\lambda$ is the wavelength , m e the electron mass (charge e {\textless} 0), and c the speed of light. The suppression $\gamma$ 0 ∝ 1/p i is due to the electron dephasing from the laser pulse [27]. A lot of research has been dedicated to mitigating the negative impact of the dephasing in order to increase the electron energy gain [13, 28, 29]. Quasi-static electric fields caused by charge separation have been shown to alter the dephasing, which leads to an enhanced energy exchange between the electrons and the laser [30]. However, this principle is not applicable at next generation laser facilities, such as ELI [31], Apollon [32], and XCELS [33], whose pulses would induce such strong transverse plasma electric fields that the ion motion would become important on time scales shorter than the pulse duration. The resulting transverse ion motion has been shown to dramatically reduce the quasi-static electric fields needed for achieving the electron energy enhancement [34].},

abstract = {Conventionally, friction is understood as an efficient dissipation mechanism depleting a physical system of energy as an unavoidable feature of any realistic device involving moving parts, e.g., in mechanical brakes. In this work, we demonstrate that this intuitive picture loses validity in nonlinear quantum electrodynamics, exemplified in a scenario where spatially random friction counter-intuitively results in a highly directional energy flow. This peculiar behavior is caused by radiation friction, i.e., the energy loss of an accelerated charge due to the emission of radiation. We demonstrate analytically and numerically how radiation friction can enhance the performance of a specific class of laser-driven particle accelerators. We find the unexpected directional energy boost to be due to the particles' energy being reduced through friction whence the driving laser can accelerate them more efficiently. In a quantitative case we find the energy of the laser-accelerated particles to be enhanced by orders of magnitude.},

Based on this, we also develop an adaptive event generator that subdivides the time step for locally resolving QED events, allowing for efficient simulation of cascades.

abstract = {Guiding of relativistically intense laser pulses with peak power of 0.85 PW over 15 diffraction lengths was demonstrated by increasing the focusing strength of a capillary discharge waveguide using laser inverse bremsstrahlung heating. This allowed for the production of electron beams with quasimonoe-nergetic peaks up to 7. Laser plasma accelerators (LPAs) [1,2] have large acceleration gradients of tens to hundreds of GV/m, which is several orders of magnitude larger than conventional radio frequency technology. This could allow for compact accelerators in a variety of applications, including free-electron lasers [3-5], Thomson sources [6,7], and electron-positron colliders with TeV energy [8,9]. For future efficient colliders using PW-class laser systems, single-stage energy gains of about 10 GeV are required [9]. Electron beams with energy up to a few GeV have been observed using nonpreformed plasmas and petawatt laser systems [10-12]. Preformed plasma waveguides can be used to mitigate laser diffraction of focused laser pulses, which increases the acceleration length and the energy gain for a given laser power. Using a capillary discharge waveguide to confine laser pulses over a distance of 9 cm, electron beams with energy up to 4.2 GeV were produced using a lower peak laser power of 300 TW [13]. The energy gain of a single-stage LPA [1] scales inversely with plasma density, n 0 , since the accelerating gradient scales as E z ∝ n 1=2 0 , and the length is limited to the laser-depletion length, which scales as L d ∝ n −3=2 0. This scaling shows that in order to increase the energy gain to ≈ 10 GeV, the plasma density must be lowered relative to past experiments [10-13]. However, in order to accelerate over the full laser-depletion length and achieve maximum energy gain, diffraction of the focused laser pulses and the associated reduction in laser intensity must be mitigated. This laser pulse guiding can be achieved with a preformed plasma channel, in which the electron density is lower on axis, creating a refractive index profile that is peaked on axis [14], as is the case with graded-index optical fibers. For a parabolic channel with density rise (channel depth) $\Delta$n at a radius r ch given by nðrÞ ¼ n 0 þ ð$\Delta$n=r 2 ch Þr 2 , a low intensity transversely Gaussian laser pulse can propagate with constant spot size when the input laser mode size equals the matched spot size of the channel (r 0 ¼ r m), where r m ¼ ½$\pi$r e ð$\Delta$n=r 2 ch Þ −1=4 and r e is the classical electron radius. The capillary discharge waveguide [15] has been shown to be an effective method both of producing plasma channels and increasing energy gain in laser plasma accelerators through increased acceleration length [13,16,17]. The discharge current ionizes and heats the plasma via Ohmic heating. Since the plasma cools at the capillary wall, a temperature maximum and density minimum is formed on the capillary axis [18]. In order to increase energy gain toward 10 GeV [19], the laser power must be increased to the petawatt level, the plasma density reduced to ≈ 2 × 10 17 cm −3 , and the guiding achieved over twice the number of diffraction ranges (≈ 15 Z R) relative to previous experiments [13]. However, at this plasma density, and for the capillary diameter required to avoid laser damage, the capillary discharge waveguide produces a channel that is not deep enough to sufficiently confine the laser pulse. In this Letter we show that the channel depth of a capillary discharge waveguide can be increased using laser pulses of nanosecond length to locally heat the plasma along the capillary axis [20], and that this structure can extend the LPA length to 20 cm (15 diffraction lengths) at low (≈ 3.0 × 10 17 cm −3) density. This enabled the generation of electron beams with quasimonoenergetic peaks in energy up to 7.8 GeV using a peak laser power of 850 TW.

First, it is shown that the most fundamental S-similarity is valid for both under- and overdense plasmas. Then, the particular case of tenious plasma is considered in great detail. It is shown that the electron dynamics in this case has two characteristic scales. The fast scale corresponds to relaxation to some attractor solution. The slow dynamics describes an adiabatic evolution of this attractor. This leads to a remarkable wave breaking exclusion rule in the 3D geometry. A similarity theory for the slow dynamics allows obtaining simple ``engineering'' scalings for the maximum electron energies, the number of accelerated electrons, the electron beam density, and for the acceleration distance. These scalings are aimed at design of a high-energy laser-plasma accelerator generating electron beams with superior properties.},

abstract = {We demonstrate analytically and numerically that focusing of high harmonics produced by the reflection of a few-femtosecond laser pulse from a concave plasma surface opens a new way to unprecedentally high intensities. The key features allowing the boosting of the focal intensity are the harmonics coherency and the small exponent of the power-law decay of the harmonics spectrum. Using similarity theory and direct particle-in-cell simulations, we find that the intensity at the focus scales as ICHF∝a30I0, where a0 and I0∝a20 are the dimensionless relativistic amplitude and the intensity of the incident laser pulse. The scaling suggests that due to the coherent harmonic focusing (CHF), the Schwinger intensity limit can be reached using lasers with I0≈1022 W/cm2. The pulse duration at the focus scales as $\tau$CHF∝1/a20 and reaches the subattosecond range.},

Pair production in this regime can thus be described as more nonperturbative than the usual Schwinger process, which appears at one loop. Unfortunately, such high temperatures appear to be out of reach of foreseeable technologies, though nonthermal photon distributions with comparable energy-densities are possible. We suggest the possibility that similar nonperturbative enhancements may extend out of equilibrium and propose an experimental scheme to test this.},

Moreover, the accelerated beams feature strong longitudinal phase-space correlations with sub-percent uncorrelated energy spreads. Tuning of density down-ramp injection is explored by scanning the slope and length of the downward transition. It is found that the mechanism causes particle trapping over a wide experimentally accessible parameter range.

abstract = {The orbit of the Earth about the Sun produces an annual modulation in the weakly interacting massive particles (WIMP) direct detection rate. If the local WIMP velocity distribution is isotropic then the modulation is roughly sinusoidal with maximum in June; however, if the velocity distribution is anisotropic the phase and shape of the signal can change. Motivated by conflicting claims about the effect of uncertainties in the local velocity distribution on the interpretation of the DAMA annual modulation signal (and the possibility that the form of the modulation could be used to probe the structure of the Milky Way halo), we study the dependence of the annual modulation on various astrophysical inputs. We first examine the approximations used for the Earth's motion about the Sun and the Sun's velocity with respect to the Galactic rest frame. We find that overly simplistic assumptions lead to errors of up to ten days in the phase and up to tens of percent in the shape of the signal, even if the velocity distribution is isotropic. Crucially, if the components of the Earth's velocity perpendicular to the motion of the Sun are neglected, then the change in the phase which occurs for anisotropic velocity distributions is missed. We then examine how the annual modulation signal varies for physically and observationally well-motivated velocity distributions. We find that the phase of the signal changes by up to 20 days and the mean value and amplitude change by up to tens of percent.},

Together, these encompass five of the six nuclear responses extracted from the non-relativistic effective theory of [Fitzpatrick et al, arXiv:1203.3542] (with the sixth difficult to UV complete), with two of the six combinations corresponding to standard spin-independent and -dependent responses. For constraints from existing direct detection experiments, we find that only the COUPP constraint, due to its heavy iodine target with large angular momentum and an unpaired spin, and its large energy range sensitivity, is substantially modified by the new responses compared to what would be inferred using the standard form factors to model the energy dependence of the response. For heavy targets such as xenon and germanium, the behavior of the new nuclear responses as recoil energy increases can be substantially different than that of the standard responses, but this has almost no impact on the constraints derived from experiments such as LUX, XENON100 and CDMS since the maximum nuclear recoil energy detected in these experiments is relatively low. We simulate mock data for 80 and 250 GeV DM candidates utilizing the new nuclear responses to highlight how they might affect a putative signal, and find the new responses are most important for momentum-suppressed interactions such as the magnetic dipole or pseudoscalar-mediated interaction when the target is relatively heavy (such as xenon and iodine).},

The QED cascades are studied with multi-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations complemented by a QED module and a macro-particle merging algorithm that allows to handle the exponential growth of the number of particles. Results range from moderate-intensity regimes (∼10 PW) where the laser absorption is negligible to extreme intensities ({\textgreater}100 PW) where the degree of absorption reaches 80{\%}.

abstract = {Electron–positron pair production via Breit–Wheeler process requires laser intensities approaching 1024 W cm−2 due to the small cross-section. Here, we propose a mechanism for brilliant $\gamma$-ray emission and dense GeV pairs creation accompanied with high-harmonic generation by using plasma mirror and an ultra short pulse with the intensity of 3 × 1023 W cm−2. The laser is reflected by the solid surface after propagating tens of microns in a near-critical density plasma and breaks into short wave packets. The intensity of the reflected high order harmonic field is enhanced by the focusing and compression effects from the deformed oscillating mirror. The radiation trapped electrons emit $\gamma$-photons while colliding with the reflected attosecond pulses. The peak intensity of the $\gamma$-ray reaches 0.74 PW with the brilliance of 2 × 1024 s−1 mm−2 mrad−2 (0.1{\%}BW)−1 (at 58 MeV).

abstract = {Ultrafast betatron x-ray emission from electron oscillations in laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA) has been widely investigated as a promising source. Betatron x-rays are usually produced via self-injected electron beams, which are not controllable and are not optimized for x-ray yields. Here, we present a new method for bright hard x-ray emission via ionization injection from the K-shell electrons of nitrogen into the accelerating bucket. A total photon yield of 8 × 10 8 /shot and 10 8 photons with energy greater than 110 keV is obtained. The yield is 10 times higher than that achieved with self-injection mode in helium under similar laser parameters. The simulation suggests that ionization-injected electrons are quickly accelerated to the driving laser region and are subsequently driven into betatron resonance. The present scheme enables the single-stage betatron radiation from LWFA to be extended to bright $\gamma$-ray radiation, which is beyond the capability of 3 rd generation synchrotrons.},

By passing the electron bunch through a small pinholelike collimator, we could generate a quasimonoenergetic high-energy electron beam, in which electrons within a cone angle of 0.25 mrad (f/70) were selected. The beam clearly showed a narrow-energy-spread behavior with a central energy of 4.3 MeV and a charge of 200 pC. The acceleration gradient was estimated to be about 30 GeV/m. Particle-in-cell simulations were performed for comparison study and the result shows that both the experimental and simulation results are in good agreement and the electron trapping is initiated by the slow beat wave of the Raman backward wave and the incident laser pulse.},

abstract = {Dynamic focusing of a 3.8 MeV electron bunch, a few collisionless skin depths long -3c/car, by an overdense, thick plasma lens has been demonstrated. Because of electron inertial effects, the head of the bunch is virtually unaffected by the lens while the rest is focused to varying degree. Time-resolved mea-surements performed 3l cm downstream of the plasma lens show that, in time, the bunch pinches from an initial size of 2.7 mm (FWHM) to about 0.57 mm and then expands, in reasonable agreement with theory. PACS numbers: 52.40.Mj, 41.75.Ht In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the accelerator physics community to explore plasma based lenses [1] and accelerators [2]. In principle, a plasma lens can provide an azimuthally symmetric, focusing gra-dient of — 100 MG/cm, exceeding that of conventional quadrupole lens by several orders of magnitude [3]. In-creasing the focusing gradients of conventional lenses is one of the main challenges for the future colliders where beams of extremely small spot sizes and high luminosity are required at the interaction point [4). However, be-cause the colliding bunches [4,5] in these machines are short ((10 ps) and nonuniform in time, the focusing process would be highly dynamic if a plasma lens is uti-lized. In this Letter, such dynamic focusing of a 3.8 MeV, 25 ps (FWHM) long electron bunch by an over-dense plasma lens (nt, «np where ns and np are the bunch and plasma density, respectively) has been demonstrated for the first time. The basic concept of a plasma lens is as follows [6]: As a relativistic electron beam enters a plasma, the plasma electrons charge neutralize the beam on a I/top time scale, where tap is the plasma electron frequency. How-ever, if the collisionless skin depth (e/cop) is larger than the beam radius, most of the axial plasma return current flows on the outside of the beam, and the beam current is not fully neutralized. Consequently, the beam pinches [7] radially due to its own magnetic field. This is in con-trast to the "active" plasma lens [8] (e.g. , a z-pinch plas-ma) where the focusing magnetic field is due to an exter-nally driven plasma current. Experimentally, relativistic electron beam self-focusing and guiding in plasmas have been observed [9]. In most of these experiments, howev-er, the plasma length was much longer than the betatron oscillation wavelength [)Ltt 2ttrol(21/1{\~{}}) 'l where ra is the beam radius, and I and I{\~{}} are the beam and Alfven currents, respectively]. As a result, the beam undergoes multiple, large amplitude, transverse oscillations which lead to transverse emittance growth [10]. Eventually, the betatron oscillations are damped due to a spread in the betatron wavelength [11] (phase mixing), and the beam attains an equilibrium radius which has been previously measured [9,12]. For the plasma lens to be useful, the plasma column, must be shorter than X{\&}/4 to prevent the degradation of the beam emittance which ultimately lim-its the minimum spot size. In this experiment, the focal length of the plasma lens was longer than the length of the plasma column. In analogy to an optical lens, the plasma lens imparts a radially symmetric, inward kick to the azimuthally symmetric bunch which brings it to a focus outside of the plasma. The only other reported plasma lens experiment [13] has demonstrated a very limited focusing, less than a 20{\%} reduction in spot size, and with no temporal resolution. In this Letter, we report the results of an experiment {\~{}}here the dynamic focusing process, which leads to a factor of 4 reduction in trans-verse bunch size, is time resolved. The experiment was performed with a laser driven, . photocathode RF accelerator [14] which produces 25 ps long, 3.8 MeV electron bunches at 1 Hz containing up to 1.5 nC per bunch. The electron bunches were transport-ed to the plasma chamber located 2 m downstream of the gun with a focusing solenoid at the exit of the accelerator and four steering magnets along the beam line. The plas-ma chamber which was filled with Ar gas up to a pressure of 20 m Torr was connected to the RF gun (p (5x 10 Torr) through a windowless, two stage differential pump-ing system. Each pumping stage consisted of a low con-ductance tube followed by a turbomolecular pump. Since the beam encountered no windows, the beam emittance was not degraded due to multiple scattering.

The tailored density distribution is achieved experimentally by inserting a narrow nozzle, with an orifice diameter of only 400 $\mu$m, into a jet of gas supplied from a 2mmdiameter nozzle. The combination of these two nozzles is used to create two regions of different density connected by a density gradient. Using this setup we show independent control of the charge and energy distribution of the bunches of accelerated electron as well as decreased shot-to-shot fluctuations in these quantities compared to self-injection in a single gas jet. Although the energy spectra are broad after injection, simulations show that further acceleration acts to compress the energy distribution and to yield peaked energy spectra.},

abstract = {The covariant dynamics of a single classical electron subjected to the electromagnetic field of an intense, linearly polarized, ultrashort laser pulse in vacuum is studied in the context of the Dirac- Lorentz equation, which has long been suggested as a possible theory which includes radiative reaction. The Dirac-Lorentz equation is integrated numerically using Dirac's suggestion that the acausal (no runaway) solution should produce physically interesting consequences. This appears to be the case in our Compton scattering calculations, although the exact meaning of the results is not clear.},

Important applications that would benefit from such new hard x-ray and-ray sources include the following: nuclear resonance fluorescence spectroscopy and isotopic imaging, time-resolved positron annihilation spectroscopy, and MeV flash radiography. In this paper, the peak brightness of Compton scattering light sources is derived for head-on collisions and found to scale quadratically with the normalized energy, ; inversely with the electron beam duration, , and the square of its normalized emittance, "; and linearly with the bunch charge, eN e , and the number of photons in the laser pulse, N : {\^{}} B x / 2 N e N =" 2. This 2 scaling shows that for low normalized emittance electron beams (1 nC, 1 mm mrad, {\textless}1 ps, {\textgreater}100 MeV), and tabletop laser systems (1-10 J, 5 ps) the x-ray peak brightness can exceed 10 23 photons=mm 2 mrad 2 s 0:1{\%} bandwidth near "! x  1 MeV; this is confirmed by three-dimensional codes that have been benchmarked against Compton scattering experiments performed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The interaction geometry under consideration is head-on collisions, where the x-ray flash duration is shown to be equal to that of the electron bunch, and which produce the highest peak brightness for compressed electron beams. Important nonlinear effects, including spectral broadening, are also taken into account in our analysis; they show that there is an optimum laser pulse duration in this geometry, of the order of a few picoseconds, in sharp contrast with the initial approach to laser-driven Compton scattering sources where femtosecond laser systems were thought to be mandatory. The analytical expression for the peak on-axis brightness derived here is a powerful tool to efficiently explore the 12-dimensional parameter space corresponding to the phase spaces of both the electron and incident laser beams and to determine optimum conditions for producing high-brightness x rays.},

abstract = {We review known and discuss new signatures of high-intensity Compton scattering assuming a scenario where a high-power laser is brought into collision with an electron beam. At high intensities one expects to see a substantial red-shift of the usual kinematic Compton edge of the photon spectrum caused by the large, intensity dependent, effective mass of the electrons within the laser beam. Emission rates acquire their global maximum at this edge while neighbouring smaller peaks signal higher harmonics. In addition, we find that the notion of the centre-of-mass frame for a given harmonic becomes intensity dependent. Tuning the intensity then effectively amounts to changing the frame of reference, going continuously from inverse to ordinary Compton scattering with the centre-of-mass kinematics defining the transition point between the two.},

abstract = {We study the effects of laser pulse focussing on the spectral properties of Thomson scattered radiation. Modelling the laser as a paraxial beam we find that, in all but the most extreme cases of focussing, the temporal envelope has a much bigger effect on the spectrum than the focussing itself. For the case of ultra-short pulses where the paraxial model is no longer valid, we adopt a sub-cycle vector beam description of the field. It is found that the emission harmonics are blue shifted and broaden out in frequency space as the pulse becomes shorter. Additionally the carrier envelope phase becomes important, resulting in an angular asymmetry in the spectrum. We then use the same model to study the effects of focussing beyond the limit where the paraxial expansion is valid. It is found that fields focussed to sub-wavelength spot sizes produce spectra that are qualitatively similar to those from sub-cycle pulses due to the shortening of the pulse with focussing. Finally, we study high-intensity fields and find that, in general, the focussing makes negligible difference to the spectra in the regime of radiation reaction.},

abstract = {Acceleration of particles by intense laser-plasma interactions represents a rapidly evolving field of interest, as highlighted by the recent demonstration of laser-driven relativistic beams of monoenergetic electrons. Ultrahigh-intensity lasers can produce accelerating fields of 10 TV m(-1) (1 TV = 10(12) V), surpassing those in conventional accelerators by six orders of magnitude. Laser-driven ions with energies of several MeV per nucleon have also been produced. Such ion beams exhibit unprecedented characteristics--short pulse lengths, high currents and low transverse emittance--but their exponential energy spectra have almost 100{\%} energy spread. This large energy spread, which is a consequence of the experimental conditions used to date, remains the biggest impediment to the wider use of this technology. Here we report the production of quasi-monoenergetic laser-driven C5+ ions with a vastly reduced energy spread of 17{\%}. The ions have a mean energy of 3 MeV per nucleon (full-width at half-maximum approximately 0.5 MeV per nucleon) and a longitudinal emittance of less than 2 x 10(-6) eV s for pulse durations shorter than 1 ps. Such laser-driven, high-current, quasi-monoenergetic ion sources may enable significant advances in the development of compact MeV ion accelerators, new diagnostics, medical physics, inertial confinement fusion and fast ignition.},

abstract = {We discuss intensity effects in collisions between beams of optical photons from a high-power laser and relativistic electrons. Our main focus are the modifications of the emission spectra due to realistic finite-beam geometries. By carefully analyzing the classical limit we precisely quantify the distinction between strong-field QED Compton scattering and classical Thomson scattering. A purely classical, but fully covariant, calculation of the bremsstrahlung emitted by an electron in a plane wave laser field yields radiation into harmonics, as expected. This result is generalized to pulses of finite duration and explains the appearance of line broadening and harmonic substructure as an interference phenomenon. The ensuing numerical treatment confirms that strong focussing of the laser leads to a broad continuum while higher harmonics become visible only at moderate focussing, hence lower intensity. We present a scaling law for the backscattered photon spectral density which facilitates averaging over electron beam phase space. Finally, we propose a set of realistic parameters such that the observation of intensity induced spectral red-shift, higher harmonics, and their substructure, becomes feasible.},

abstract = {In this dissertation, a fully object-oriented, fully relativistic, multi-dimensional Particle-In-Cell code was developed and applied to answer key questions in plasma-based accelerator research. The simulations increase the understanding of the processes in laser plasma and beam-plasma interaction, allow for comparison with experiments, and motivate the development of theoretical models. The simulations support the idea that the injection of electrons in a plasma wave by using a transversely propagating laser pulse is possible. The beam parameters of the injected electrons found in the simulations compare reasonably with beams produced by conventional methods and therefore laser injection is an interesting concept for future plasma-based accelerators. Simulations of the optical guiding of a laser wakefield driver in a parabolic plasma channel support the idea that electrons can be accelerated over distances much longer than the Rayleigh length in a channel. Simulations of plasma wakefield acceleration in the nonlinear blowout regime give a detailed picture of of the highly nonlinear processes involved. Using OSIRIS, we have also been able to perform full scale simulations of the E-157 experiment at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. These simulations have aided the experimentalists and they have assisted in the development of a theoretical model that is able to reproduce some important aspects of the full PIC simulations. Update (2015): This dissertation was originally written in 2000. I am making it now available on arXiv with the hope that some its content might proof useful to the users of the OSIRIS code which has continued to be utilized by a number of research groups since it was originally written as part of the research presented in this dissertation.},

abstract = {This brief review describes a class of uniquely crafted particle physics experiments that typically each tackle just one investigation—and they do that very well. The aim of these experiments is to both establish Standard Model parameters and also to provide unique tests in search of new physics. I provide a brief snapshot of many of the current activities, selected with a bias toward low-energy and high precision. These include searches for permanent electric dipole moments, charged lepton flavor violation, tests of the weak interaction, and other broad searches for deviations from very precise Standard Model predictions, such as the muon's anomalous magnetic moment. I highlight what drives these efforts and how they might impact a new Standard Model.},

abstract = {X-ray phase-contrast radiography and tomography enables to increase contrast for weakly absorbing materials. Recently, x-ray grating interferometers were developed which extend the possibility of phase-contrast imaging from highly brilliant radiation sources like third-generation synchrotron even to non-coherent sources. Here, we present a setup of an x-ray grating interferometer designed and installed at low-coherence wiggler source at the GKSS beamline W2 (HARWI II) operated at the second-generation synchrotron storage ring DORIS at the Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY, Hamburg, Germany). The beamline is dedicated to imaging in materials science. Equipped with the grating interferometer, it is the first synchrotron radiation beamline with a three-grating setup combining the advantages of phase-contrast imaging with monochromatic radiation with very high flux and a sufficiently large field of view for centimeter sized objects. Examples of radiography on laser-welded aluminum and magnesium joints are presented to demonstrate the high potential of the new grating-based setup in the field of materials science. In addition, the results of an off-axis phase-contrast tomography of a human urethra with 15 mm in diameter are presented showing internal structures, which cannot be resolved by the conventional tomography in absorption mode.},

These monoenergetic bunches are characteristic of wakefield acceleration in the highly nonlinear wave breaking regime, which was previously thought to be accessible only by much shorter laser pulses in thinner plasmas. In our experiment, the initially long laser pulse was modified in underdense plasma to match the necessary conditions. This picture is confirmed by semianalytical scaling laws and 3D particle-in-cell simulations. Our results show that laser-plasma interaction can drive itself towards this type of laser wakefield acceleration even if the initial laser and plasma parameters are outside the required regime.},

abstract = {An overview on the underlying principles of the hybrid plasma wakefield acceleration scheme dubbed "Trojan Horse" acceleration is given. The concept is based on laser-controlled release of electrons directly into a particle-beam-driven plasma blowout, paving the way for controlled, shapeable electron bunches with ultralow emittance and ultrahigh brightness. Combining the virtues of a low-ionization-threshold underdense photocathode with the GV/m-scale electric fields of a practically dephasing-free beam-driven plasma blowout, this constitutes a 4th generation $\backslash$nelectron acceleration scheme. It is applicable as a beam brightness transformer for electron bunches from LWFA and PWFA systems alike. At FACET, the proof-of-concept experiment "E-210: Trojan Horse Plasma Wakefield Acceleration" has recently been approved and is in preparation. At the same time, various LWFA facilities are currently considered to host experiments aiming at stabilizing and boosting the electron bunch output quality via a trojan horse afterburner stage. Since normalized emittance and brightness can be improved by many orders of magnitude, the scheme is an ideal candidate for light sources such as free-electron-lasers and those based on Thomson scattering and betatron radiation alike.},

abstract = {Laser-driven plasma accelerators can generate accelerating gradients three orders of magnitude larger than radio-frequency accelerators and have achieved beam energies above 1 GeV in centimetre long stages. However, the pulse repetition rate and wall-plug efficiency of plasma accelerators is limited by the driving laser to less than approximately 1 Hz and 0.1{\{}{\%}{\}} respectively. Here we investigate the prospects for exciting the plasma wave with trains of low-energy laser pulses rather than a single high-energy pulse. Resonantly exciting the wakefield in this way would enable the use of different technologies, such as fibre or thin-disc lasers, which are able to operate at multi-kilohertz pulse repetition rates and with wall-plug efficiencies two orders of magnitude higher than current laser systems. We outline the parameters of efficient, GeV-scale, 10-kHz plasma accelerators and show that they could drive compact X-ray sources with average photon fluxes comparable to those of third-generation light source but with significantly improved temporal resolution. Likewise FEL operation could be driven with comparable peak power but with significantly larger repetition rates than extant FELs.},

It is found that the circular target can significantly enhance the density of $\gamma$-photons than plane target when two colliding circularly polarized lasers irradiate the target. By multi-lasers irradiate the circular target, the optical trap of lasers can prevent the high energy electrons accelerated by laser radiation pressure from escaping. Hence, high density as 5164n c $\gamma$-photons is obtained through nonlinear Compton back-scattering. Meanwhile, 2.7 × 10 11 positrons with average energy of 230 MeV is achieved via multi-photon Breit-Wheeler process. Such ultrabright $\gamma$-ray source and dense positrons source can be useful to many applications. The optimal target radius and laser mismatching deviation parameters are also discussed in detail.},

A controlled electron injection scheme and a method for phase-space manipulation in a laser plasma accelerator are found to be essential. The injection is triggered by the evolution of two copropagating laser pulses near a sharp vacuum-plasma transition. The collection volume is well confined and the injected bunch is isolated in phase space. By tuning the parameters of the laser pulses, the parameters of the injected electron bunch, such as the bunch length, energy spread, emittance and charge, can be adjusted. Manipulating the phase-space rotation with the rephasing technique, the injected electron bunch can be accelerated to GeV level while keeping relative energy spread below 0.5{\%} and transverse emittance below 1.0 $\mu$m. The results present a very promising way to drive coherent x-ray sources.},

In particular, the betatron hard x-ray photon yield is 10 times higher compared to the case of helium gas under the same laser parameters.

It is shown that by adjusting the relative phase between two intense laser pulses, their interaction features in plasmas are well controlled, which subsequently induce different electron acceleration processes. In this case, the properties of the accelerated electron beam, including the directionality, the maximum energy, and the conversion efficiency, can be controlled though the manipulation of the energy redistribution of these intense laser pulses. In particular, compared to the cases with a single laser pulse or two out-of-phase laser pulses, two in-phase laser pulses fuse into a much stronger laser pulse, which significantly prolongs the electron acceleration length in plasmas and leads to the generation of energetic electron beam with much higher conversion efficiency.},

abstract = {Laser-wakefield accelerators (LWFAs) are high acceleration-gradient plasma-based particle accelerators capable of producing ultra-relativistic electron beams. Within the strong focusing fields of the wakefield, accelerated electrons undergo betatron oscillations, emitting a bright pulse of X-rays with a micrometer-scale source size that may be used for imaging applications. Non-destructive X-ray phase contrast imaging and tomography of heterogeneous materials can provide insight into their processing, structure, and performance. To demonstrate the imaging capability of X-rays from an LWFA we have examined an irregular eutectic in the aluminum-silicon (Al-Si) system. The lamellar spacing of the Al-Si eutectic microstructure is on the order of a few micrometers, thus requiring high spatial resolution. We present comparisons between the sharpness and spatial resolution in phase contrast images of this eutectic alloy obtained via X-ray phase contrast imaging at the Swiss Light Source (SLS) synchrotron and X-ray projection microscopy via an LWFA source. An upper bound on the resolving power of 2.7 ± 0.3 $\mu$m of the LWFA source in this experiment was measured. These results indicate that betatron X-rays from laser wakefield acceleration can provide an alternative to conventional synchrotron sources for high resolution imaging of eutectics and, more broadly, complex microstructures. Laser-wakefield acceleration (LWFA) is a method for producing high-energy electron beams using the accelerating field structure produced in the wake of a high-power, ultrashort pulsed laser propagating through low density plasma. During wakefield acceleration, an electron bunch "surfs" on the electric wave generated by the light pressure of an intense laser pulse 1. This wave induces a strong longitudinal electric field that remains in phase with the relativistic driver, enabling relativistic electrons to gain significant energy from the accelerating field over long distances. Due to the lack of a breakdown limit in a plasma accelerator, accelerating gradients 1000 times stronger than those produced in conventional sources can be produced 1,2 and the generation of high energy electron beams has been demonstrated experimentally 3-9. Additionally, in the highly nonlinear regime, electrons undergo betatron oscillations in the strong focusing fields of the wakefield, emitting a bright source of X-rays with a source size as small as one micrometer 10-12. Betatron X-ray beams produced via LWFA have been shown to produce},

The validity of the LCFA has been questioned in the parameter regime of current laser experiments, and improvements to it are needed. Using nonlinear Compton scattering in laser fields to illustrate, we show here how to overcome the problems inherent in corrections to the LCFA. We derive an "LCFA+" which, comparing with the full QED result, shows an improvement over the LCFA across the whole photon emission spectrum. We also demonstrate a numerical implementation of our results in the codes used to design and analyse intense laser experiments.},

abstract = {Strong background fields require a non-perturbative treatment, which is afforded in QED by the Furry expansion of scattering amplitudes. It has been conjectured that this expansion breaks down for sufficiently strong fields, based on the asymptotic growth of loop corrections with increasing "quantum nonlinearity", essentially the product of field strength and particle energy. However, calculations to date have assumed that the background is constant. We show here, using general plane waves of finite duration, that observables at high quantum nonlinearity scale differently depending on whether intensity or energy is large. We find that, at high energy, loop contributions to observables tend to fall with increasing quantum nonlinearity, rather than grow.},

Laser pulses at these intensities reach giga-bar level radiation pressures, which can push the plasma critical surface where laser light is reflected. This process is referred to as the laser hole boring (HB), which is critical for plasma heating, hence essential for laser-based applications. Here we derive the limit density for HB, which is the maximum plasma density the laser can reach, as a function of laser intensity. The time scale for when the laser pulse reaches the limit density is also derived. These theories are confirmed by a series of particle-in-cell simulations. After reaching the limit density, the plasma starts to blowout back toward the laser, and is accompanied by copious superthermal electrons; therefore, the electron energy can be determined by varying the laser pulse length.},

These properties are experimentally verified by measuring betatron radiation from a cm-scale laser wakefield accelerator (LWFA) driven by a 1-PW laser, using a differential filtering spectrometer consisting of a 15-filter and image plate stack. The gamma-ray spectra were derived by unfolding the photostimulated luminescence (PSL) values recorded on the image plates, using the spectrometer response matrix modeled with the Monte Carlo code GEANT4. The accuracy of unfolded betatron radiation spectra was assessed by unfolding the test PSL data simulated with GEANT4, showing an ambiguity of less than 20{\%} and clear discrimination from the background radiation with less than 10{\%}. The spectral analysis of betatron radiation from laser wakefield-accelerated electron beams with energies up to 3 GeV revealed radiation spectra characterized by synchrotron radiation with the critical photon energy up to 7 MeV. The gamma-ray spectrometer and unfolding method presented here facilitate an in-depth understanding of betatron radiation from LWFA process and a novel radiation source of high-quality photon beams in the MeV regime.},

When the laser field reaches the threshold, the RR force becomes significant enough to compensate for the expelling laser ponderomotive force. Then electrons are trapped inside the laser pulse instead of being scattered off transversely and form a dense plasma bunch. The mechanism is demonstrated both by full three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations using the QED photonic approach and numerical test-particle modeling based on the classical Landau-Lifshitz formula of RR force. Furthermore, the proposed analysis shows that the threshold of laser field amplitude for RRT is approximately the cubic root of laser wavelength over classical electron radius. Because of the pinching effect of the trapped electron bunch, the required laser intensity for RRT can be further reduced.},

abstract = {When extremely intense lasers (I ≥ 1022 W/cm2) interact with plasmas, a significant fraction of the pulse energy is converted into photon emission in the multi-MeV energy range. This emission results in a radiation reaction (RR) force on electrons, which becomes important at ultrahigh intensities. Using three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations which include a quantum electrodynamics model for the $\gamma$–photons emission, the corresponding RR force and electron-positron pair creation, the energy partition in the laser-plasma system is investigated. At sufficiently high laser amplitudes, the fraction of laser energy coupled to electrons decreases, while the energy converted to $\gamma$-photons increases. The interaction becomes an efficient source of $\gamma$-rays when I {\textgreater} 1024 W/cm2, with up to 40{\%} of the laser energy converted to high-energy photons. A systematic study of energy partition and $\gamma$-photon emission angle shows the influence of laser intensity and polarization for two plasma conditions: high-density carbon targets and a low-density hydrogen targets. We find that in the opaque region, the laser-to-photon conversion efficiency scales as I 0 3 / 2 for linearly polarized and I 0 2 − 2.5 for circularly polarized lasers, respectively. In the relativistically transparent regime, the power-laws merge into I 0 1 / 2 for both polarizations and photon emission peaks in the forward direction with a relatively small divergence angle ({\textless}20°), resulting in a collimated $\gamma$-ray beam.},

It could break down 60.9{\%} lignin in reeds at 30. °C under conditions of static culture within 15. days. In order to analyze the diversity of LDC, plate isolation, 16S rDNA clone library and ARDRA (Amplified Ribosomal DNA Restriction Analysis) were performed. Six bacterial strains were isolated from LDC and eighteen DNA phylotypes were identified from 230 bacterial analyzed clones. They were classified into Clostridiales (9.1{\%}), Geovibrio thiophilus (5.1{\%}), Desulfomicrobium (10.9{\%}), Pseudomonas sp. (25.2{\%}), Azoarcus sp. (5.1{\%}), Thauera (5.1{\%}), Paenibacillus sp. (5.1{\%}), Cohnella sp. (2.2{\%}), Acinetobacter sp. (3.1{\%}), Microbacterium (7.8{\%}), and uncultured bacterium (21.3{\%}). In addition, physical characteristics of paper hand-sheets between biological pretreatment and chemical pretreatment were compared. The results showed that LDC had the capability of lignin degradation and was efficient for pulping, which would provide a new choice for biopulping. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Robust plasma accelerating structures can now be excited over centimeter scales using short laser pulses and over meter scales using ultrarelativistic particle beams. Accelerating fields in excess of tens of GV/m can be sustained over these lengths. Laser-driven plasma accelerators now routinely produce monoenergetic, low divergence electron beams in the 100 MeV – 1 GeV range, whereas electron-beam driven plasma accelerators have demonstrated the ability to double the energy of 42 GeV electrons using a high-energy collider beam in less than one meter.

abstract = {It is demonstrated by experiments and supporting particle simulations that the forward Raman instability is capable of producing extremely high-energy electrons in an under-dense plasma. The instability has a high saturation level for the electrostatic wave com-ponent. Its consequences and applications to the laser electron accelerator and the laser-fusion pellet preheat are discussed. PACS numbers: 42.65.Cq, 52.35.Mw, 52.25.ps, 52.60.+ h Although Raman backscatter has been under ac-tive investigation lately, ' the Raman forward scat-tering (RFS) instability has hitherto received rela-tively little attention. We demonstrate, however, in this Letter that RFS can dominate backscatter when the pump is reasonably strong and/or the electron temperature is high for underdense plas-mas. Furthermore, extremely relativistic elec-trons are produced by the nonlinear damping of the high-phase-velocity electron plasma waves (EPW) characteristic of the RFS process. In this Letter we present results from an experiment which looks directly at forward-emitted electrons f rom a high-temperature, underdense plasma ir-radiated by an intense CO, -laser pulse. Relativis-tic electromagnetic particle simulations of the experiment indeed confirm that RFS is responsi-ble for the observed electron acceleration to rela-tivistic energies. The role of BFS in ultrahigh-energy electron generation was investigated experimentally and checked against particle simulations by using the same relevant parameters. 130-A-thick, self-supported carbon foils were irradiated at normal incidence by intense, v, /c-0. 3, 700-ps full width at half maximum, CO, -laser pulses. v, =eE, / m{\~{}}0 is the quivering velocity in the laser field. 1{\%}-5{\%} of the incident energy was backscattered and roughly 50{\%}{\%}uo of the incident energy was trans-mitted by the plasma. Thus it can be assumed that the foil plasma becomes underdense around the peak of the laser pulse. The electron temper-ature of the bulk distribution was deduced from the slope of the ion spectra, recorded absolutely by use of Thomson parabolas, to be — 20 ke V for both front and rear expansions. The angular dis-tribution of the electrons escaping the plasma was measured with two absolutely calibrated electron spectrometers in the range 0.4-1.5 MeV.

If a Maxwellian distribution is assumed then these distributions can be char-acterized by temperatures of 90-100 keV in the forward direction and of 40-50 keV in the back-ward direction. Electrons with energies up to 1.4 MeV were observed in the forward direction. The highest energy electron emission ({\&} 1 MeV) was strongly peaked in the direction of the laser. Electrons up to 400 keV were observed nearly isotropically, however, probably attributable to 2{\~{}}{\~{}} decay and Raman sidescattering. By integra-tion over the measured angular distribution, as-suming azimuthal symmetry, — 10" electrons with energy greater than 400 keV are found to escape the plasma. Although no direct measure-ments of the target potential due to this loss of electrons were made, we note that target poten-tials of -200 keV have been measured under sim-ilar irradiance conditions. ' A simple estimate shows that RFS is important in our experiment. The growth rate for the RFS process' is given by y = {\&}(U, /c){\&}u{\~{}}'/{\~{}}, and the fi-nite-length limit on growth is yL/(cv,)'"{\&} 1, where U, =3k{\~{}}u, '/{\~{}}{\~{}} and L is the interaction length. Assuming U,/c — 0.3, T, — 20 keV, and {\~{}}{\~{}}/{\&}u, -0. 46, we obtain for L/A — 50, y/{\~{}}, -0. 03, and we have nearly 27 e-folding growths from the initial noise level. If instead of the resonant three-wave process we assume induced scattering by the resonant electrons (stimulated Thomson scattering) then the growth rate is smaller by a factor v,/c. For backscatter the growth rates are comparable to those for the forward scatter but backscatter suffers much more severe Landau damping due to the shorter wavelength and the lower phase velocity of the backward EP W. The assumption of a homogeneous plasma with L/A. — 50 is reasonable, since we expect the instability to occur in the density plateau region, separating the front and the rear expansions. This region has a density scale length somewhere in between the focal spot diameter (150 p, m) and the ion acoustic speed times the pulse-length full width at half maximum (1000 p, m). ln any case the depth of focus of the laser beam was — 50 wave-lengths.},

Side-view images of the scattered optical radiation at the fundamental wavelength of the laser reveal a transverse oscillation of the laser pulse during its propagation through underdense plasma. The wavelength of the oscillation $\lambda$(hosing) depends on the background plasma density n(e) and scales as $\lambda$(hosing)∼n(e)(-3/2). Comparisons with an analytical model and two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations reveal that this laser hosing can be induced by a spatiotemporal asymmetry of the intensity distribution in the laser focus which can be caused by a misalignment of the parabolic focusing mirror or of the diffraction gratings in the pulse compressor.},

@article{Kando2007,
abstract = {Since the advent of chirped pulse amplification1 the peak power of lasers has grown dramatically and opened the new branch of high field science, delivering the focused irradiance, electric fields of which drive electrons into the relativistic regime. In a plasma wake wave generated by such a laser, modulations of the electron density naturally and robustly take the shape of paraboloidal dense shells, separated by evacuated regions, moving almost at the speed of light. When we inject another counter-propagating laser pulse, it is partially reflected from the shells, acting as relativistic flying (semi-transparent) mirrors, producing an extremely time-compressed frequency-multiplied pulse which may be focused tightly to the diffraction limit. This is as if the counterstreaming laser pulse bounces off a relativistically swung tennis racket, turning the ball of the laser photons into another ball of coherent X-ray photons but with a form extremely relativistically compressed to attosecond and zeptosecond levels. Here we report the first demonstration of the frequency multiplication detected from the reflection of a weak laser pulse in the region of the wake wave generated by the driver pulse in helium plasma. This leads to the possibility of very strong pulse compression and extreme coherent light intensification. This Relativistic Tennis with photon beams is demonstrated leading to the possibility toward reaching enormous electromagnetic field intensification and finally approaching the Schwinger field, toward which the vacuum nonlinearly warps and eventually breaks, producing electron-positron pairs.},

Based on scaling of laser wakefield acceleration in the quasi-linear regime with the normalized vector potential a0 =1.4(1.6), acceleration to 100 (130) GeV requires a 30-m-long plasma waveguide operated at the plasma density ne ≈ 7 × 1015 cm−3 with a channel depth ∆n/ne = 20{\%}, while a nonlinear laser wakefield accelerator in the bubble regime with a0 ? 2 can reach 100 GeV approximately in a 36/a0-m-long plasma through self-guiding. The third option is a hybrid concept that employs a ponderomotive channel created by a long leading pulse for guiding a short trailing driving laser pulse. The detail parameters for three options are evaluated, optimizing the operating plasma density at which a given energy gain is obtained over the dephasing length and the matched conditions for propagation of relativistic laser pulses in plasma channels, including the self-guiding. For the production of high-quality beams with 1{\%}-level energy spread and a 1$\pi$-mm-mrad- level transverse normalized emittance at 100-MeV energy, a simple scheme based on the ionization-induced injection mechanism may be conceived. We investigate electron beam dynamics and effects of synchrotron radiation due to betatron motion by solving the beam dynamics equations on energy and beam radius numerically. For the bubble regime case with a0 = 4, radiative energy loss becomes 10{\%} at the maximum energy of 90 GeV.},

In the limiting case of low frequencies these expressions change into the well known formulas for the probability of tunnel auto-ionization; at high frequencies they describe processes in which several photons are absorbed simultaneously. The ionization probability has a number of resonance maxima due to intermediate transition of the atom to an excited state. In the vicinity of such a maximum the ionization cross section increases by several orders of mag- nitude. The positions and widths of the resonances depend on the field strength in the wave. It is shown that for optical frequencies the mechanism under consideration, of direct ioniza- tion by the wave field, may be significant in the case of electric breakdown in gases, and es- pecially in condensed media.},

However, the energy and quality of the electron beam from the laser-wakefield accelerator have been limited by the power of the driving laser pulses and interaction properties in the target medium. Recent progress in laser technology has resulted in the realization of a petawatt (PW) femtosecond laser, which offers new capabilities for research on laser-wakefield acceleration. Here, we present a significant increase in laser-driven electron energy to the multi-GeV level by utilizing a 30-fs, 1-PW laser system. In particular, a dual-stage laser-wakefield acceleration scheme (injector and accelerator scheme) was applied to boost electron energies to over 3 GeV with a single PW laser pulse.

abstract = {The achievable energy and the stability of accelerated electron beams have been the most critical issues in laser wakefield acceleration. As laser propagation, plasma wave formation and electron acceleration are highly nonlinear processes, the laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA) is extremely sensitive to initial experimental conditions. We propose a simple and elegant waveform control method for the LWFA process to enhance the performance of a laser electron accelerator by applying a fully optical and programmable technique to control the chirp of PW laser pulses. We found sensitive dependence of energy and stability of electron beams on the spectral phase of laser pulses and obtained stable 2-GeV electron beams from a 1-cm gas cell of helium. The waveform control technique for LWFA would prompt practical applications of centimeter-scale GeV-electron accelerators to a compact radiation sources in the x-ray and $\gamma$-ray regions. Laser wakefield electron accelerators 1 have strong potential for a next generation accelerator due to its huge acceleration field. Laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA) has been intensively investigated to produce quasi-mono-energetic collimated GeV electron beams in centimeter-scale acceleration length 2–4 . Recent pro-gresses of LWFA demonstrated quasi-mono-energetic electron beams in the hundreds MeV range that are pro-duced in a stable way by utilizing methods such as colliding laser pulses 5, 6 , ionization injection 7–10 and density gradient injection 11–14 with an improvement of the stability that results from explored injection schemes. Here we propose a simple method to enhance the energy and the stability of multi-GeV electron beams 15–17 by controlling the waveform of PW laser pulses using a fully optical, programmable method 18–20 . LWFA is based on the interaction between an underdense plasma and an intense laser pulse. The interaction between a driving laser pulse and a plasma in LWFA is a complex process occurring in the relativistic regime, because the formation of plasma waves and electron acceleration processes are highly nonlinear while the prop-agating laser pulse is strongly modified by the medium 21, 22},

The maximum energy was close to the theoretical limit predicted from the bubble model. This means that the length of the plasma was sufficiently long to accelerate the electron to the dephasing length after the electrons were self-injected by self-focusing. As the plasma density increased, the dephasing length decreased and the electron energy decreased. The continuous injection with higher density plasmas generated highly diverging beams. As the laser power increased, a number of electron beams with different propagation directions were generated. As shown by the measured shadowgram, the laser was divided into several filaments and each filament accelerated electron beam having different directions. The electron beam generated at this time decreased as the laser energy decreased due the division of the laser into different directions.},

abstract = {In order to develop a stable and efficient laser wakefield accelerator by transition injection, the characteristics of the plasma density generated in a gas medium by shock was experimentally measured. The density difference between before and after the shock, and the density after the shock are important parameters for determining the charge and energy of the electron beam in the transition injection scheme. Based on experiments, we developed an adjustment method of these parameters and measured the characteristics of the electron beam by using the shock structure. The shock structure in the gas medium was generated by inserting a blade in a supersonic gas nozzle, and plasma was generated by using a 16-TW laser. Before the shock, the density increases and after that, the density is the same as the density without the shock. The ratio of the density difference was in the range of ∼ 0.1-0.6, which could be adjusted according to the position of the blade. The density after the shock was adjustable by varying the distance between the laser and the nozzle, and it was in a suitable range of ∼ 5 × 10 18 cm −3-1.2 × 10 19 cm −3 for the electron acceleration. The measured electron beam indicates that the position of the shock needs to be in the range of ∼ 0.3-0.5 mm before the laser focal position in the vacuum because of faster laser focus due to self-focusing.},

abstract = {Filamentary structures can form within the beam of protons accelerated during the interaction of an intense laser pulse with an ultrathin foil target. Such behaviour is shown to be dependent upon the formation time of quasi-static magnetic field structures throughout the target volume and the extent of the rear surface proton expansion over the same period. This is observed via both numerical and experimental investigations. By controlling the intensity profile of the laser drive, via the use of two temporally separated pulses, both the initial rear surface proton expansion and magnetic field formation time can be varied, resulting in modification to the degree of filamentary structure present within the laser-driven proton beam.},

A selection of physical solutions by the methods presented herein guarantees that the conservation laws are satisfied. In the first approximation , which is the only one utilized in the majority of physical situations, radiation damping does not depend on assumptions concerning the structure of the charge of the particle. A theory is presented of the losses of energy, momentum and angular momentum by a system of charged particles in the course of their moving together taking into account the external field, the radiation damping forces, and the retarded Lienard-Wiechert forces. Formulas are given for the spectral and angular distribution of the radiation from a system of particles. The concept of a center of a system of events with relativistic particles is utilized in constructing a system of equations for finding the angular momenta of the electromagnetic waves radiated by particles of the system. The angular distribution and the total intensity of the radiation from a system of particles at an arbitrary instant of time is obtained. Using the example of the joint synchrotron radiation from two particles the consistency of all three approaches to the radiation from a system of particles is demonstrated. CONTENTS},

abstract = {Each successive generation of X-ray machines has opened up new frontiers in science, such as the first radiographs and the determination of the structure of DNA. State-of-the-art X-ray sources can now produce coherent high-brightness X- rays of greater than kiloelectronvolt energy and promise a new revolution in imaging complex systems on nanometre and femtosecond scales. Despite the demand, only a fewdedicated synchrotron facilities exist worldwide, in part because of the size and cost of conventional (accelerator) technology1. Here we demonstrate the use of a new generation of laser- driven plasma accelerators2, which accelerate high-charge electron beams to high energy in short distances3–5, to produce directional, spatially coherent, intrinsically ultrafast beams of hard X-rays. This reduces the size of the synchrotron source from the tens of metres to the centimetre scale, simultaneously accelerating and wiggling the electron beam. The resulting X-ray source is 1,000 times brighter than previously reported plasma wigglers6,7 and thus has the potential to facilitate a myriad of uses across the whole spectrum of light-source applications.},

abstract = {The dynamics of relativistic electrons in a laser driven plasma cavity are studied via measurements of their radiation. For ultrashort laser pulses at comparatively low focused laser intensities (3 {\textless} a0 {\textless} 10), low density and long f-number of 10, electrons are predominantly accelerated in the wakefield leading to quasi-monoenergetic collimated electron beams and well collimated ({\textless} 12 mrad) beams of comparatively soft x-rays (1-10 keV) with unprecedented small source size (2-3 $\mu$m). For laser pulses with increasing laser intensity (10 {\textless} a0 {\textless} 30), density and short f-number ({\textless} 5), electrons are accelerated directly by the laser, leading to divergent quasimaxwellian electron beams and divergent (50-95°) beams of hard x-rays (20-50 keV) with relatively large source size ({\textgreater} 100 $\mu$m). In both cases, the measured x-rays are well described in the synchrotron asymptotic limit of electrons oscillating in a plasma channel. At low laser intensity transverse oscillations are small as the electrons are predominantly accelerated axially by the laser generated wakefield. At high laser intensity, electrons are directly accelerated by the laser. A betatron resonance leads to a tenfold increase in transverse oscillation amplitude and electrons enter a highly radiative regime with up to 5{\%} of their energy converted into x-rays.},

Betatron radiation was also measured with ten times longer and more intense pulses from the Vulcan Petawatt laser. In this case, electron acceleration is strongly driven transversely by the laser and a betatron resonance leads to a tenfold increase in oscil- lation amplitude.

Large differences are found between the case where damping is included and not included. In particular, the first harmonic of the backscatteredradiation is downshifted and the overall amplitude of the spectra is smaller than in the case with no damping. An analytical expression for the downshift is obtained and found to agree fairly well with the numerical calculations.},

The gas cell was designed to study controlled injection of electrons into a laser-driven wakefield at the Astra Gemini laser facility. The target consists of two compartments: an accelerator and an injector section connected via an aperture. A sharp transition between the peak and plateau density regions in the injector and accelerator compartments, respectively, was observed in simulations with various inlet pressures. The fluid simulations indicate that the length of the down-ramp connecting the sections depends on the aperture diameter, as does the density drop outside the entrance and the exit cones. Further studies showed, that increasing the inlet pressure leads to turbulence and strong fluctuations in density along the axial profile during target filling, and consequently, is expected to negatively impact the accelerator stability.},

Field ionization in this regime is studied analytically and numerically. For analytical studies, both the classical and the quantum approaches are used. Two approximations to solve the time-dependent Schr$\backslash$"odinger equation are proposed: the free electron approximation, in which the atomic potential is neglected, and the motionless approximation, in which only the external field term is considered. In the motionless approximation, the ionization rate in extremely strong fields is derived. The approximations are applied to several model potentials and are verified using numeric simulations of the Schr$\backslash$"odinger equation. A simple formula of the ionization rate both for the tunnel and the barrier-suppression regimes is proposed. The formula can be used, for example, in particle-in-cell codes for simulations of the interaction of extremely intense laser fields with matter.},

abstract = {High-intensity femtosecond laser-plasma interaction experiments were performed to investigate laser-plasma wakefield acceleration in the "bubble" regime. Using a 15 TW laser pulse, the emission of side-scattered radiation was spectrally and spatially resolved and was consequently used to diagnose the evolution of the laser pulse during the acceleration process. Side-scattered emission was observed immediately before wavebreaking at a frequency of $\omega$ L + 1.7$\omega$ p (where $\omega$ L is the laser frequency and $\omega$ p is the background plasma frequency). This emission may result from scattering of laser light by large amplitude plasma oscillations generated in the shell of the wakefield "bubble" and which occurs immediately prior to the wavebreaking/injection process. The observed variation of the frequency of scattered light with electron density agrees with theoretical estimates. There have been many experiments in the past decade which have demonstrated that high-energy quasi-monoenergetic electron beams can be produced as a result of the interaction of intense laser pulses with underdense plasmas. Relativistic electron beams are generated via acceleration from large amplitude relativistic plasma waves (Faure et al., 2004; Geddes et al., 2004; Mangles et al., 2004, 2006) which are created in the wake of the laser pulse as it propagates through the plasma. In the resonant regime at high power-where the laser pulse duration is less than the relativistic plasma wavelength, the plasma wave generated forms a "bubble"-shaped accelerating structure. Recently, electron beams with energies {\textgreater}1 GeV have been observed using short-pulse high repetition rate laser systems using plasma waveguides (Leemans et al., 2006) or gases (Hafz et al., 2008; Kneip et al., 2009) as the target. One of the most important aspects of research in this field is to understand the injection of electrons into such wakefields. For best electron beam quality with regard to emittance, energy spread, reproducibility, and pulse duration, the injection of electrons into the "bubble" needs to be well controlled. There has been considerable research into the development of techniques to improve the beam quality in this way (Faure et al., 2006; Geddes et al., 2008; McGuffey et al., 2010). In this paper, we discuss experimental measurements of scattered light from the interaction of an intense laser pulse with plasma as it accelerates mono-energetic electron beams from these interactions. These measurements suggest that prior to injection of the electrons into the wakefield, an instability occurs which drives non-linear short wavelength plasma oscillations in the bubble. The observed wavelength of the scattered emission agrees with the plasma frequency in the plasma "bubble" wall. Electron injection into the plasma wave occurs when the electric field in the plasma bubble reaches a "threshold" value which may also enable the generation of perturbations in the plasma wakefield structure and the production of plasma waves. Oscillations in the plasma bubble were previously observed in simulations to lead to injection and acceleration (Kalmykov et al., 2009). Our experimental observations are in general agreement with those results. The observed scattered light is most likely due to collective Thomson scattering from related oscillations in the plasma. Such measurements of scattered light with both high spectral and spatial resolution can provide detailed information about the dynamics of these accelerators as well as the injection mechanisms and also demonstrates the existence of this new "bubble instability" associated with laser wakefield self-injection. The experiment used the ASTRA Titanium:Sapphire laser system at the Central Laser Facility of the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in the UK. The laser pulses ($\lambda$ = 800 nm, E = 350 mJ, $\tau$ = 40 fsec) were focused with an f/10 off-axis parabolic mirror onto the edge of a 2 mm-long supersonic jet of helium gas to produce intensities on the order of 1.3 × 10 18 W/cm 2. The plasma density was controlled by varying the backing pressure of the gas jet. The electron density as a function of backing pressure was determined by measuring the frequency shift ($\Delta$$\omega$ = $\omega$ pe where $\omega$ pe is the electron plasma frequency) of satellite lines near the laser wavelength which result from forward Raman scattering. Direct interferometric measurements were also used. The plasma density was observed to vary linearly with backing pressure},

abstract = {We report on the first demonstration of passive all-optical plasma lensing using a two-stage setup. An intense femtosecond laser accelerates electrons in a laser wakefield accelerator (LWFA) to 100 MeVover millimeter length scales. By adding a second gas target behind the initial LWFAstage we introduce a robust and independently tunable plasma lens. We observe a density dependent reduction of the LWFA electron beam divergence from an initial value of 2.3 mrad, down to 1.4 mrad (rms), when the plasma lens is in operation. Such a plasma lens provides a simple and compact approach for divergence reduction well matched to the mm-scale length of the LWFA accelerator. The focusing forces are provided solely by the plasma and driven by the bunch itself only, making this a highly useful and conceptually new approach to electron beam focusing. Possible applications of this lens are not limited to laser plasma accelerators. Since no active driver is needed the passive plasma lens is also suited for high repetition rate focusing of electron bunches. Its understanding is also required for modeling the evolution of the driving particle bunch in particle driven wake field acceleration.},

abstract = {Controlling the parameters of a laser plasma accelerated electron beam is a topic of intense research with a particular focus placed on controlling the injection phase of electrons into the accelerating structure from the background plasma. An essential prerequisite for high-quality beams is dark-current free acceleration (i.e., no electrons accelerated beyond those deliberately injected). We show that small-scale density ripples in the background plasma are sufficient to cause the uncontrolled (self-)injection of electrons. Such ripples can be as short as ∼50 $\mu$m and can therefore not be resolved by standard interferometry. Background free injection with substantially improved beam characteristics (divergence and pointing) is demonstrated in a gas cell designed for a controlled gas flow. The results are supported by an analytical theory as well as 3D particle in cell simulations.},

An important current application of these scattering processes is the generation of ultrashort-pulse-duration x rays. In this tutorial, the classical theory of nonlinear Thomson scattering of an electron in an intense laser field is presented. It is found that the orbit, and therefore its nonlinear scattering spectra, depends on the amplitude and on the phase at which the electron sees the laser electric field. Novel, simple asymptotic expansions are obtained for the spectrum of radiation that is backscattered from a laser by a counter-propagating (or co-propagating) electron. The solutions are presented in such a way that they explicitly show-at least in the single particle regime-the relative merit of using an intense laser and of an energetic electron beam in x-ray production.

abstract = {The laser wakefield acceleration [1] by a high power laser pulse and a plasma has attracted lots of attention in recent years as it can generate quasi-monoenergetic high-energy electron beams [2–5] and it may be used for a compact x-ray source on a table-top scale [6–10]. In the laser wakefield acceleration, plasma electrons can be self-injected into the acceleration phase of the wake wave and they are accelerated with an extremely high gradient in the longitudinal direction. In addition to the longi-tudinal acceleration, the wake wave also gives an ultra-strong focusing force in the transverse direction. As a result, the accelerated electrons execute the betatron oscillations which can produce the betatron radiation. The radiations with shorter wavelengths can be generated with higher e-beam energies and larger betatron oscillation amplitudes for a given plasma den-sity. In general, however, the plasma density is already deter-mined by the laser pulse duration for resonant excitation of the wake wave (i.e. $\tau$ $\lambda$ ≈ c / p with the plasma wavelength $\lambda$ p and c is the light speed in free space) and the electron beam energy is mainly limited by the available laser power. Therefore, if the betatron oscillation amplitude can be increased somehow, it will provide an important way for generation of shorter wave-length radiations, especially in the hard x-ray regime. In this paper, we propose a new method to increase the betatron oscillation amplitude by off-axis laser alignment to a capillary plasma waveguide. It is common knowledge that the capillary plasma waveguide has been used only for optical guiding and electron acceleration [5], where the transverse plasma density profile is nearly parabolic, but recently the study for enhanced betatron oscillation motion using a cor-rugated guiding channel was discussed [11]. In their method, however, they simply assumed an ideal plasma density pro-file for pure theoretical studies and it will be very difficult to realize the corrugated plasma channel experimentally. In our work, we found that the betatron oscillation amplitude can be significantly increased by off-axis laser alignment to the cap-illary plasma waveguide, which can be done very easily for the generation of shorter wavelength x-ray radiations. In this paper, detailed results of the work are described.},

abstract = {Laser-wakefield acceleration constitutes a promising technology for future electron accelerators. A crucial step in such an accelerator is the injection of electrons into the wakefield, which will largely determine the properties of the extracted beam. We present here a new paradigm of colliding-pulse injection, which allows us to generate high-quality electron bunches having both a very low emittance (0.17 mm{\textperiodcentered}mrad) and a low energy spread (2{\%}), while retaining a high charge (∼100 pC) and a short duration (3 fs). In this paradigm, the pulse collision provokes a transient expansion of the accelerating bubble, which then leads to transverse electron injection. This mechanism contrasts with previously observed optical injection mechanisms, which were essentially longitudinal. We also specify the range of parameters in which this new type of injection occurs and show that it is within reach of existing high-intensity laser facilities.},

abstract = {Thanks to their compactness and unique properties, laser-wakefield accelerators are currently considered for several innovative applications. However, many of these applications—and especially those that require beam transport—are hindered by the large divergence of laser-accelerated beams. Here we propose a collimating concept that relies on the strong radial electric field of the laser-wakefield to reduce this divergence. This concept utilizes an additional gas jet, placed after the laser-wakefield accelerator. When the laser pulse propagates through this additional gas jet, it drives a wakefield which can refocus the trailing electron bunch. Particle-in-cell simulations demonstrate that this approach can reduce the divergence by at least a factor of 3 for realistic electron bunches.},

Different from the previous method by collision of an ultraintense laser with a high-energy electron beam, in which the radiation reaction effect is evidenced by the energy loss in the electron energy spectrum, here the transition between the classical and quantum radiation reaction regimes is distinguished from the angular distribution of the total electron radiations. With no need of additional relativistic electron beams, the scheme is more robust and easily achievable in experiments.

abstract = {In this paper, we address the energy spread and slice energy spread of an externally injected electron beam in plasma wakefield accelerators operating in the linear or quasilinear regime. The energy spread is first derived taking into account the phase dependence of the wakefield along the finite-length bunch together with the dephasing during acceleration and found to be strongly dependent on the bunch length. This could be compensated by the beam loading effect, the energy spread from which is then derived and found to be nearly independent of the bunch length. However, the transverse dependence of the beam loading effect also makes the particles at the same longitudinal position experience different accelerating fields, introducing a significant slice energy spread. To estimate the slice energy spread, a theoretical analysis was conducted by taking the transverse betatron motion into account. As a study case, 3D simulations for the 5 GeV laser-plasma acceleration stage of the European Plasma Research Accelerator with eXcellence in Applications project have been performed. Careful optimization of the parameters allows one to obtain an energy spread of ≤1{\%} and a slice energy spread of ≤0.1{\%}, with good agreement between theories and simulations.},

This acceleration technique is now starting to be planned for providing high-quality beams to well-defined user communities. High beam energy is also considered by piling successive plasma acceleration stages. In this context, avoiding beam degradation, on top of all emittance degradation, is the main concern when transferring the accelerated beam to the users or to the following acceleration stage. After examining the behavior of the trace and the phase emittances when crossing through a conventional transfer line, we are able to determine the criteria to be achieved in the plasma ramps so as to minimize emittance growth. Then the optimal density profile is studied for these ramps at the entrance and exit of a plasma stage accelerating electrons from the energy of 150 MeV to 5 GeV. Finally, the design of an optimal transfer line allows showing that the emittance growth can be contained to less than 10{\%} in realistic conditions when transferring a beam to a free-electron laser.},

abstract = {Spin-polarization of an ultrarelativistic electron beam head-on colliding with an ultraintense laser pulse is investigated in the quantum radiation-reaction regime. We develop a Monte-Carlo method to model electron radiative spin effects in arbitrary electromagnetic fields by employing spin-resolved radiation probabilities in the local constant field approximation. Due to spin-dependent radiation reaction, the applied elliptically polarized laser pulse polarizes the initially unpolarized electron beam and splits it along the propagation direction into two oppositely transversely polarized parts with a splitting angle of about tens of milliradians. Thus, a dense electron beam with above 70{\%} polarization can be generated in tens of femtoseconds. The proposed method demonstrates a way for relativistic electron beam polarization with currently achievable laser facilities. Introduction. Spin-polarized electron beams have been extensively employed to investigate matter properties, atomic and molecular structures [1-3]. In high-energy physics, rel-ativistic polarized electron beams can be used to probe the nuclear structure [4, 5], generate polarized photons [6, 7] and positrons [6, 8], study parity violation in M{\o}ller scattering [9] and new physics beyond the Standard Model [10]. There are many methods to generate polarized electron beams at low energies [1]. However, for relativistic electron beams, there are mainly two methods [11]. In the first method mostly used in the Stanford Linear Accelerator, the polarized electrons are first extracted from a photocathode (illuminated by a circularly polarized light) [12, 13] and then, accelerated by the linear accelerator (alternatively one may use polarized electrons from spin filters [14] or beam splitters [15], with subsequent laser wakefield acceleration [16]). The second method is a direct way of polarization of a relativistic electron beam in a storage ring via radiative polarization (Sokolov-Ternov effect) [17-24]. The polarization time of the latter due to the synchrotron radiation is rather slow (typically from minutes to hours), since the magnetic fields of a synchrotron are too weak (in the order of 1 Tesla). The electrons are polarized transversely due to Sokolov-Ternov effect. As mostly longitudinal polarization is interesting in high-energy physics, spin rotation systems are applied [25]. Moreover, for creating polarized positron beams (also applicable for electrons) Compton scattering or Bremsstrahlung of circularly polarized lasers and successive pair creation are commonly used [26-30]. The polarization of relativistic electrons can be detected by Compton scattering [31], M{\o}ller scattering [32], or other methods.},

abstract = {There has been growing interest both in studying high-intensity ultrafast laser plasma interactions with adaptive control systems as well as using long wavelength driver beams. We demonstrate the coherent control of the dynamics of laser-wakefield acceleration driven by ultrashort (∼ 100 fs) mid-infrared (∼ 3.9 µm) laser pulses. The critical density at this wavelength is 7.3 × 10 19 cm −3 , which is achievable with an ordinary gas target system. Interactions between mid-infrared laser pulses and such near-critical-density plasma may be beneficial due to much higher absorption of laser energy. In addition, the normalized vector potential of the laser field a 0 increases with longer laser wavelength, lowering the required peak laser intensity to drive non-linear laser-wakefield acceleration. Here, MeV level, collimated electron beams with non-thermal, peaked energy spectra are generated. Optimization of electron beam qualities are realized through adaptive control of the laser wavefront. A genetic algorithm controlling a deformable mirror improves the electron total charge, energy spectra, beam pointing and stability at various plasma density profiles. Particle-in-cell simulations reveal that the optimal wavefront causes an earlier injection on the density up-ramp and thus higher energy gain as well as less filamentation during the interaction, which leads to the improvement in electron beam collimation and energy spectra.},

abstract = {Ten years ago, the authors of this report published a first paper on the technical challenges that laser accelerators need to overcome before they could be applied to tumor therapy. Among the major issues were the maximum energy of the accelerated ions and their intensity, control and reproducibility of the laser-pulse output, quality assurance and patient safety. These issues remain today. While theoretical progress has been made for designing transport systems, for tailoring the plumes of laser-generated protons, and for suitable dose delivery, today's best lasers are far from reaching performance levels, in both proton energy and intensity to seriously consider clinical ion beam therapy (IBT) application. This report details these points and substantiates that laser-based IBT is neither superior to IBT with conventional particle accelerators nor ready to replace it. I. INTRODUCTION " What will it take for laser driven proton accelerators to be applied to tumor therapy? " was the title of a first article by Linz and Alonso on the challenges for laser-driven proton accelerators in 2007 [1]. In the intervening ten years considerable theoretical progress has been made on handling of the less-than-ideal beams of protons that might be produced with lasers, but progress on the necessary lasers has been a lot slower than anticipated. Proton energies and intensities are still not close to the levels suitable for therapy applications, even with the most powerful lasers. The bold predictions for rapid advances towards clinically viable laser-based proton accelerator systems [2–6] have proven premature. Meanwhile, proton therapy facilities based on conventional accelerators continue to expand, with great strides being made in size and cost reduction [7,8]. In the past ten years the total number of patients treated with ion beam therapy (IBT) from conventional acceler-ators has more than tripled (155000 vs 48000). Roughly 17000 patients are currently treated per year, approximately twice as many as in 2007. The number of IBT facilities has more than doubled from 27 to 62. In 2016, more than 30 additional IBT centers are under construction [9]. As now several new facilities for ions heavier than protons have opened, the ratio of proton to carbon ion therapy has shifted from 10∶1 to 6∶1 (Fig. 1).},

abstract = {High-efficiency acceleration of charged particle beams at high gradients of energy gain per unit length is necessary to achieve an affordable and compact high-energy collider. The plasma wakefield accelerator is one concept being developed for this purpose. In plasma wakefield acceleration, a charge-density wake with high accelerating fields is driven by the passage of an ultra-relativistic bunch of charged particles (the drive bunch) through a plasma. If a second bunch of relativistic electrons (the trailing bunch) with sufficient charge follows in the wake of the drive bunch at an appropriate distance, it can be efficiently accelerated to high energy. Previous experiments using just a single 42-gigaelectronvolt drive bunch have accelerated electrons with a continuous energy spectrum and a maximum energy of up to 85 gigaelectronvolts from the tail of the same bunch in less than a metre of plasma. However, the total charge of these accelerated electrons was insufficient to extract a substantial amount of energy from the wake. Here we report high-efficiency acceleration of a discrete trailing bunch of electrons that contains sufficient charge to extract a substantial amount of energy from the high-gradient, nonlinear plasma wakefield accelerator. Specifically, we show the acceleration of about 74 picocoulombs of charge contained in the core of the trailing bunch in an accelerating gradient of about 4.4 gigavolts per metre. These core particles gain about 1.6 gigaelectronvolts of energy per particle, with a final energy spread as low as 0.7 per cent (2.0 per cent on average), and an energy-transfer efficiency from the wake to the bunch that can exceed 30 per cent (17.7 per cent on average). This acceleration of a distinct bunch of electrons containing a substantial charge and having a small energy spread with both a high accelerating gradient and a high energy-transfer efficiency represents a milestone in the development of plasma wakefield acceleration into a compact and affordable accelerator technology.},

Two laser pulses from the same laser system were used: one to accelerate electrons and one to scatter. Since the two pulses play very different roles in the $\gamma$-ray generation process, and thus have different requirements, a novel laser system was developed.

abstract = {The extraordinary ability of space-charge waves in plasmas to accelerate charged particles at gradients that are orders of magnitude greater than in current accelerators has been well documented. We develop a phenomenological framework for Laser WakeField Acceleration (LWFA) in the 3D nonlinear regime, in which the plasma electrons are expelled by the radiation pressure of a short pulse laser, leading to nearly complete blowout. Our theory provides a recipe for designing a LWFA for given laser and plasma parameters and estimates the number and the energy of the accelerated electrons whether self-injected or externally injected. These formulas apply for self-guided as well as externally guided pulses (e.g. by plasma channels). We demonstrate our results by presenting a sample Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulation of a 30f sec, 200T W laser interacting with a 0.75cm long plasma with density 1.5*10{\^{}}18 cm{\^{}}-3 to produce an ultra-short (10f s) mono-energetic bunch of self-injected electrons at 1.5 GeV with 0.3nC of charge. For future higher-energy accelerator applications we propose a parameter space, that is distinct from that described by Gordienko and Pukhov [Physics of Plasmas 12, 043109 (2005)] in that it involves lower densities and wider spot sizes while keeping the intensity relatively constant. We find that this helps increase the output electron beam energy while keeping the efficiency high.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, IMechE 2017. As the main bearing components of vehicle wheel/rail systems, railway bearings take on the main load of wheel/rail system. These bearings can be easily damaged after a long-term load, which causes vibrations and significant deterioration of force distribution and directly affects the driving stability of the locomotive. Current systems available for modeling the dynamics of wheel/rail systems rarely consider nonlinear contact load bearing, which causes errors in the calculation of wheel/rail system dynamics. According to the bearing structure characteristics and working features of a specific system, this paper thoroughly evaluates the flexible deformation of shaft and bearing, time-varying nonlinear contact load, track irregularity, and bearing to establish a wheel/rail system coupling dynamics model. Then, based on the coupling dynamics theoretical model, the wheel/rail system's coupling nonlinear dynamic characteristics are studied under random load. Then, this theoretical model of the wheel–bearing–rail system dynamics is verified using the railway bearing as an example. Finally, the model is applied to the process of rail/wheel low force design. Results show that under irregular stimulation, the maximum contact load increased by 71.2{\%} and the maximum contact stress increased by 19.6{\%}. After moderate wear, the wheel/rail system vibration and loading condition deteriorate rapidly. Under the low rail/wheel force, the wheel tread and diameter had significant effects on wheel/rail contact force distribution. The rail specifications are found to affect the wheel/rail system's vibration significantly. This paper has important theoretical value and practical significance for developing reliable railway bearings and wheel/rail systems with good static/dynamic characteristics that can withstand dynamic impact load.},

Current staging schemes feed subsequent laser pulses into stages using plasma mirrors, while controlling electron beam focusing with plasma lenses. Here a more compact and efficient scheme is proposed to realize simultaneous coupling of the electron beam and the laser pulse into a second stage. A curved channel with transition segment is used to guide a fresh laser pulse into a subsequent straight channel, while allowing the electrons to propagate in a straight channel. This scheme benefits from a shorter coupling distance and continuous guiding of the electrons in plasma, while suppressing transverse beam dispersion. With moderate laser parameters, particle-in-cell simulations demonstrate that the electron beam from a previous stage can be efficiently injected into a subsequent stage for further acceleration, while maintaining high capture efficiency, stability, and beam quality.},

The radiation reaction of the electron is incorporated by modeling it as an Unruh-DeWitt detector and setting the energy gap equal to the recoil momentum produced by the emitted photon. In the subsequent analysis, we discover a vacuum Larmor formula and an in-medium power spectrum that are both thermalized by the acceleration. As such, these systems will explicitly exhibit thermalization of radiation reaction at the celebrated Fulling-Davies-Unruh temperature. Therefore, our theory proves that detections of radiation reaction associated with recoil are, in fact, simultaneous observations of the Unruh effect. Our derived power spectrum is then shown to have an excellent agreement with the recent experiment on quantum radiation reaction in aligned crystals and therefore provides evidence for the very first observation of the Unruh effect.},

The analysis is performed in the framework of strong-field quantum electrodynamics, with the laser field taken into account exactly in the calculations. We consider different emission regimes depending on the laser intensity, placing special emphasis on the regime of one-cycle beams and of high laser intensities, where the emission spectra depend nonperturbatively on the laser intensity. In this regime we in particular present an accurate stationary phase analysis of the integrals that are shown to determine the computed emission spectra. The emission spectra show significant differences with respect to those in a long pulsed or monochromatic laser field: the emission lines obtained here are much broader and, more important, no dressing of the electron mass is observed.},

abstract = {We propose a novel measurement technique capable of determining the temporal duration of an intense laser pulse directly in its focus at full intensity. We show that the electromagnetic radiation pattern emitted by an electron bunch with a temporal energy chirp colliding perpendicularly with the laser pulse exhibits a distinct dependence on the pulse's duration. As the electrons emit radiation into an angular region determined by the ratio of their instantaneous energy to the laser's local field strength, the temporal change of the electrons' energy imprints information about the laser's pulse duration onto the angular radiation distribution. We quantify the interaction by a simplified analytical model and confirm this model's predictions by numerical simulations of the electrons' dynamics inside a realistically focused laser field. Based on these findings the pulse's duration can be determined to an accuracy of several percent.},

abstract = {A charged particle moving through a medium emits Cherenkov radiation when its velocity exceeds the phase velocity of light in that medium. Under the influence of a strong electromagnetic field, quantum fluctuations can become polarized, imbuing the vacuum with an effective anisotropic refractive index and allowing the possibility of Cherenkov radiation from the quantum vacuum. We analyze the properties of this vacuum Cherenkov radiation in strong laser pulses and the magnetic field around a pulsar, finding regimes in which it can dominate over synchrotron radiation. This radiation process may be relevant to the excess signals of high energy photons in astrophysical observations. Quantum electrodynamics (QED) is one of the most successful and well tested theories in physics. An early prediction of QED is the presence of virtual particle-antiparticle pairs which fluctuate in and out of existence in the quantum vacuum. It has been known since the seminal work of Euler and Heisenberg [1] (see also [2]) that a strong electromagnetic field can polarize these vacuum fluctuations. This, in turn, can mediate an indirect interaction between a probe photon and the strong field such that the photon propagates as it would in a dielectric medium (for extensive reviews see [3-5] and references therein). Euler-Heisenberg theory is the result of integrating out the fermion degrees of freedom in the QED path integral, producing a nonlinear effective theory in which the photon interacts directly with the strong field. Other nonlinear theories of electrodynamics have been proposed, most notably Born-Infeld theory [6], which in its original form was an attempt to resolve the electron self-energy problem before the advent of QED. More recently , it has found a resurgence of interest due to its emergence in the low energy limit of some string theories [7, 8]. It is well known that a charged particle moving through a material medium can emit Cherenkov radiation [9, 10]. The first theoretical work to explain these results was presented by Frank and Tamm [11] (though earlier work by Heaviside [12] and Sommerfeld [13] considered similar effects). This effect occurs because, in a medium with refractive index n, the phase velocity of light is reduced, v p = c/n, so a particle traveling through the medium with velocity V {\textgreater} v p will outrun any electromagnetic waves it emits. This can lead to the emission of radiation due to the build up of wavefronts propagating from the particle, producing the well known "Cherenkov cone" of radiation behind the particle. Since vacuum fluctuations can also reduce the phase velocity of light (see for example [14]), the same argument implies that high-energy particles traveling through strong electromagnetic fields should emit Cherenkov radiation , in addition to the usual synchrotron radiation caused by acceleration in the field. First steps towards analyzing this effect were taken by Erber [15], who used the principles of QED to obtain semi-quantitative predictions for the radiation emitted by an electron in a strong magnetic field. This was followed by Ritus [16], who derived the analogous process for an electron in constant crossed fields from the effective photon mass. Subsequently Dremin [17] made more quantitative estimates for the Cherenkov radiation produced by particles crossing a laser pulse, while Marklund et al. [18] explored the possibility of Cherenkov radiation from a particle in a photon gas. In this Letter, we provide a unified description of vacuum Cherenkov radiation in nonlinear electrodynamics, applicable to arbitrary field configurations. To illustrate the approach we analyze the effect in the context of both upcoming laser facilities (e.g. the Extreme Light Infrastructure (ELI) [19]) and astrophysical sources of strong fields. In the latter, we find regimes in which the Cherenkov radiation dominates over synchrotron emission , highlighting a new and as yet unexplored mechanism for generating gamma rays, which we suggest should be further investigated in the context of the observed excess signals of astrophysical high energy photons [20-23]. Lorentz invariance of the vacuum requires nonlinear theories of electrodynamics to be constructed from La-grangians, L(X, Y), depending only on the two electromagnetic invariants, X = − 1 4 F µ$\nu$ F µ$\nu$ and Y = − 1 4 F µ$\nu$ F µ$\nu$ , where F µ$\nu$ and F µ$\nu$ are the electromagnetic field and its dual, and repeated indices imply summation. Given the success of Maxwell's theory, we consider only leading order corrections, i.e., Lagrangians of the form L = X + $\lambda$ + X 2 + $\lambda$ − Y 2 , (1) where the constants $\lambda$ ± determine the specific theory. For Euler-Heisenberg, 1 4 $\lambda$ + = 1 7 $\lambda$ − = $\alpha$ 90$\pi$ 1 E 2 S , (2) where $\alpha$ 1/137 is the fine-structure constant and E S = m 2 e /e 1.3 × 10 18 V/m is the Schwinger field [2] (we work throughout in units where c = = 1). In Born-Infeld theory the (unknown) constants coincide,},

abstract = {As an alternative to Compton backscattering and bremsstrahlung, the process of colliding high-energy electron beams with strong laser fields can more efficiently provide both cleaner and brighter source of photons in the multi-GeV range for fundamental studies in nuclear and quark-gluon physics. In order to favor the emission of high-energy quanta and minimize their decay into electron-positron pairs the fields must not only be sufficiently strong, but also well localized. We here examine these aspects and develop the concept of a laser-particle collider tailored for high-energy photon generation. We show that the use of multiple colliding laser pulses with 0.4 PW of total power is capable of converting more than 18 {\%} of the initial multi-GeV electron beam energy into photons, each of which carries more than half of the electron energy. The building and planning of several multi-PW laser facilities [1-5] and the accessibility of PW-class systems [6] have recently stimulated a strong interest in theoretical analysis of processes caused by the radiation reaction and by the phenomena of strong-field quantum electrody-namics (QED). The clarification of various theoretical aspects [7-14] as well as the development of analytical [15] and numerical [16-22] approaches has been instrumental in revealing various peculiar effects such as stochas-ticity [23-25], straggling [17, 26], quantum quenching [27], trapping in travelling [28, 29] and standing electromagnetic (EM) waves [25, 30-33] and the alteration of ponderomotive effects [25, 34]. These findings encouraged several promising proposals of both current [35, 36] and future experiments. This includes the creation of positron [37] and photon [38-44] sources as well as probing fundamental aspects of QED and astrophysics by reaching extreme conditions through self-compression of laser-driven electron-positron plasmas [45, 46]. Apart from concepts of laser-based positron, gamma and X-ray sources [47-50], which may become favored through advances in laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA) [51, and references therein], it is reasonable to also consider the use of optimally focused laser fields as targets for electron beams available with conventional accelerators. As it is today possible to create laser fields of sufficient strength for the emission of photons with energies comparable to that of the electrons, this process can provide an interesting alternative to Compton backscat-tering and bremsstrahlung, presently used in producing GeV-photons for probing nuclear and quark-gluon physics [52]. In this letter we examine and develop the concept of such a laser-particle collider, applicable with both LWFA and conventional accelerators. In particular, we show that the use of a dipole focusing [53-55] of multiple colliding laser pulses (MCLP) [56] makes sub-PW laser systems capable of converting more than 18 {\%} of the initial electron beam energy into photons with more than half of the electron energy. This holds the potential for providing clean, ultra-bright sources of photons with energies ranging from a few to several tens of GeV for new fundamental studies. We note that the MCLP configuration was shown to significantly enhance a number of strong-field QED processes: from electron-positron pair production from vacuum [56, 57], to EM cascades [39, 58-60]. Motivating estimates-An electron interacting with a strong laser field emits high-energy photons through the process of nonlinear Compton scattering. The probability of converting an electron with energy $\epsilon$ 0 = $\gamma$mc 2 into a photon carrying off a significant part of the electron's energy becomes large when the quantum nonlinearity parameter $\chi$ [61] reaches values of the order of unity. Using a standing wave structure, e.g. through MCLP, provides a geometry that maximizes $\chi$ such that it can be estimated as $\gamma$a 0 /a S. We use relativistic units for both the laser field a 0 = eE/m$\omega$c and the Sauter-Schwinger field a S = eE S /m$\omega$c ≈ 4.1 × 10 5 $\lambda$/1 µm. Here is Plank constant, c is speed of light, $\omega$ and $\lambda$ are the laser frequency and wavelength, respectively, e and m are the charge and mass of the electron respectively. Efficient conversion therefore occurs for a 0 a S /$\gamma$. If the electron experiences weaker fields, such that $\chi$ 1, but over an extended period of time its energy can be depleted through the emission of low-energy quanta (∼ $\chi$$\gamma$mc 2). On the other hand, for sufficiently strong fields, a high-energy photon can in turn decay into an electron-positron pair, through multi-photon Breit-Wheeler, as it propagates through and interacts with the laser field for a sufficiently long time.},

abstract = {Rapid progress in the development of high-intensity laser systems has extended our ability to study light–matter interactions far into the relativistic domain, in which electrons are driven to velocities close to the speed of light. As well as being of fundamental interest in their own right, these interactions enable the generation of high-energy particle beams that are short, bright and have good spatial quality. Along with steady improvements in the size, cost and repetition rate of high-intensity lasers, the unique characteristics of laser-driven particle beams are expected to be useful for a wide range of contexts, including proton therapy for the treatment of cancers, materials characterization, radiation-driven chemistry, border security through the detection of explosives, narcotics and other dangerous substances, and of course high-energy particle physics. Here, we review progress that has been made towards realizing such possibilities and the principles that underlie them.},

abstract = {Plasmas are an attractive medium for the next generation of particle accelerators because they can support electric fields greater than several hundred gigavolts per meter. These accelerating fields are generated by relativistic plasma waves-space-charge oscillations-that can be excited when a high-intensity laser propagates through a plasma. Large currents of background electrons can then be trapped and subsequently accelerated by these relativistic waves. In the forced laser wake field regime, where the laser pulse length is of the order of the plasma wavelength, we show that a gain in maximum electron energy of up to 200 megaelectronvolts can be achieved, along with an improvement in the quality of the ultrashort electron beam.},

abstract = {We present a comprehensive survey of the dynamics of spin-polarized beams in high-energy particle accelerators. A major theme of this review is to clarify the distinction between the properties of an individual particle—a spin—and that of a beam—the polarization. We include work from a number of institutions, including high- and medium-energy facilities, synchrotron light sources and muon storage rings (including a proposal to measure the muon electric dipole moment) and, briefly, linear accelerators and recirculating linacs. High-precision tests of the Standard Model using spin-polarized beams are reviewed; also innovative studies using spin dynamics as a tool for accelerator physics per se. We include important historical works as well as modern developments in the field. The fundamental theory is derived in detail, starting from the basic principles of quantum mechanics, electrodynamics and statistical mechanics, as well as 'accelerator physics'. The principal theoretical formulae in the field (Froissart–Stora, Sokolov–Ternov and Derbenev–Kondratenko) are presented, with in-depth attention to the quantum-statistical mechanics, as opposed to purely 'accelerator physics'.},

abstract = {High-power lasers that fit into a university-scale laboratory can now reach focused intensities of more than 10(19) W cm(-2) at high repetition rates. Such lasers are capable of producing beams of energetic electrons, protons and gamma-rays. Relativistic electrons are generated through the breaking of large-amplitude relativistic plasma waves created in the wake of the laser pulse as it propagates through a plasma, or through a direct interaction between the laser field and the electrons in the plasma. However, the electron beams produced from previous laser-plasma experiments have a large energy spread, limiting their use for potential applications. Here we report high-resolution energy measurements of the electron beams produced from intense laser-plasma interactions, showing that--under particular plasma conditions--it is possible to generate beams of relativistic electrons with low divergence and a small energy spread (less than three per cent). The monoenergetic features were observed in the electron energy spectrum for plasma densities just above a threshold required for breaking of the plasma wave. These features were observed consistently in the electron spectrum, although the energy of the beam was observed to vary from shot to shot. If the issue of energy reproducibility can be addressed, it should be possible to generate ultrashort monoenergetic electron bunches of tunable energy, holding great promise for the future development of 'table-top' particle accelerators.},

abstract = {A laser pulse traveling through a plasma can excite large amplitude plasma waves that can be used to accelerate relativistic electron beams in a very short distance—a technique called laser wakefield acceleration. Many wakefield acceleration experiments rely on the process of wave breaking, or self-injection, to inject electrons into the wave, while other injection techniques rely on operation without self-injection. We present an experimental study into the parameters, including the pulse energy, focal spot quality, and pulse power, that determine whether or not a wakefield accelerator will self-inject. By taking into account the processes of self-focusing and pulse compression we are able to extend a previously described theoretical model, where the minimum bubble size kprb required for trapping is not constant but varies slowly with density and find excellent agreement with this model.},

Fluctuations in the principal beam parameters, namely, electron energy, energy-spread, charge, and pointing, are demonstrated to be minimized at low densities. This improvement in stability is attributed to the reduced time for pulse evolution required before self-injection occurs; i.e., that the pulse is closest to the matched conditions for these densities. It is also observed that electrons are only consistently produced above a density-dependent energy threshold. These observations are consistent with there being a threshold intensity (a(0)greater than or similar to 3) required for the occurrence of self-injection after accounting for pulse compression.

abstract = {This thesis presents measurements of the production of relativistic electron beams from the interaction of intense lasers with underdense plasmas. Electron beam pro- duction is studied in two different regimes. Using the Vulcan Petawatt laser, with pulse durations on the order of 500 fs at intensities greater than 1020 Wcm−2 , electron energies in excess of 300 MeV have been observed. Measurements of the transmitted laser spectrum indicate that there is no correlation between the acceleration of electrons and the production of plasma waves, indicating that plasma waves are not the principal acceleration mechanism. Simulations show that the ponderomotive force of the laser pulse produces an ion channel due to the expulsion of electrons. The interaction of the laser field with the focusing force of the channel leads to significant electron acceleration. Simulations show that there is a transition from self-modulated wakefield acceleration at moderate intensities, to a regime where direct laser acceleration in cavitated channels dominates, in part because Raman scattering is suppressed due to the electron expulsion. Operating in the self-modulated wakefield regime with 70 fs, 250 mJ pulses, the Astra laser has been used to generate beams of accelerated electrons up to an energy of 20 MeV from interactions with underdense plasmas. Operating in the forced laser wakefield regime with 40 fs, 340 - 500 mJ pulses it is possible to generate beams of relativistic electrons with low divergence and a narrow energy spread (less than 3 per cent) with energies up to 70 MeV. Simulations show that monoenergetic features are formed due to transverse wavebreaking. If the issue of reproducibility can be ad- dressed, it should be possible to generate ultra-short monoenergetic electron bunches of tunable energy, holding great promise for the future development of table-top par- ticle accelerators.},

@techreport{Martins2018,
abstract = {High-intensity X-ray sources are invaluable tools, enabling experiments at the forefront of our understanding of materials science, chemistry, biology, and physics. Laser-plasma electron accelerators are sources of high-intensity X-rays, as electrons accelerated in wakefields emit short-wavelength radiation due to betatron oscillations. While applications such as phase-contrast imaging with these betatron sources have already been demonstrated, others would require higher photon number and would benefit from increased tunability. In this paper we demonstrate, through detailed 3D simulations, a novel configuration for a laser-wakefield betatron source that increases the energy of the X-ray emission and also provides increased flexibility in the tuning of the X-ray photon energy. This is made by combining two Laguerre-Gaussian pulses with non-zero net orbital angular momentum, leading to a rotation of the intensity pattern, and hence, of the driven wakefields. The helical motion driven by the laser rotation is found to dominate the radiation emission, rather than the betatron oscillations. Moreover, the radius of this helical motion can be controlled through the laser spot size and orbital angular momentum indexes, meaning that the radiation can be tuned fully independently of the plasma parameters.},

abstract = {Plasma-based acceleration offers compact accelerators with potential applications for high-energy physics and photon sources. The past five years have seen an explosion of experimental results with monoenergetic electron beams up to 1 GeV on a centimetre-scale, using plasma waves driven by intense lasers. The next decade will see tremendous increases in laser power and energy, permitting beam energies beyond 10 GeV. Leveraging on the Lorentz transformations to bring the laser and plasma spatial scales together, we have reduced the computational time for modelling laser–plasma accelerators by several orders of magnitude, including all the relevant physics. This scheme enables the first one-to-one particle-in-cell simulations of the next generation of accelerators at the energy frontier. Our results demonstrate that, for a given laser energy, choices in laser and plasma parameters strongly affect the output electron beam energy, charge and quality, and that all of these parameters can be optimized.},

A witness beam can itself cause hosing and/or may be affected by the hosing of the drive beam. The accurate study of hosing including a witness beam is of utmost importance to facilitate stable plasma-based accelerators. In this contribution, we discuss novel methods for the mitigation of hosing and present a new model for the evolution of the plasma centroid, which enables the accurate investigation of the hose instability of drive and witness beam pair in the nonlinear blowout regime.

abstract = {Ionization-induced injection mechanism was introduced in 2010 to reduce the laser intensity threshold for controllable electron trapping in laser wakefield accelerators (LWFA). However, usually it generates electron beams with continuous energy spectra. Subsequently, a dual-stage target separating the injection and acceleration processes was regarded as essential to achieve narrow energy-spread electron beams by ionization injection. Recently, we numerically proposed a self-truncation scenario of the ionization injection process based upon overshooting of the laser-focusing in plasma which can reduce the electron injection length down to a few hundred micrometers, leading to accelerated beams with extremely low energy-spread in a single-stage. Here, using 100 TW-class laser pulses we report experimental observations of this injection scenario in centimeter-long plasma leading to the generation of narrow energy-spread GeV electron beams, demonstrating its robustness and scalability. Compared with the self-injection and dual-stage schemes, the self-truncated ionization injection generates higher-quality electron beams at lower intensities and densities, and is therefore promising for practical applications.},

The ability to acquire the desired information within a single exposure is important for dynamic samples, as is sufficient sensitivity to reveal small variations in the composition or thickness of such a sample. This approach satisfies both these needs by analyzing how a reference grid pattern is deformed by the presence of the sample, similar to a Shack-Hartmann sensor. By resolving the shift of the pattern into horizontal and vertical components, a quantitative phase depth map is recovered, sensitive to both sharp edges as well as low phase gradients.},

abstract = {We present a simple x-ray phase imaging method that utilizes the sample-induced distortion of a high contrast random intensity pattern to quantitatively retrieve the two-dimensional phase map at the exit surface of a coherently illuminated sample. This reference pattern is created by placing a sheet of sandpaper in the x-ray beam, with the sample-induced distortion observed after propagation to the detector, a meter downstream. Correlation analysis comparing a single “sample and sandpaper” image to a reference “sandpaper only” image produces two sensitive differential phase contrast images, giving the sample phase gradient in vertical and horizontal directions. These images are then integrated to recover the projected phase depth of the sample. The simple experimental set-up, retention of flux, and the need for only a single sample image per reconstruction suggest that this method is of value in imaging a range of dynamic processes at both synchrotron and laboratory x-ray sources. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Institute of Physics},

abstract = {Laser wakefield accelerators can produce electric fields of order 10 – 100 GV ∕ m , suitable for acceleration of electrons to relativistic energies. The wakefields are excited by a relativistically intense laser pulse propagating through a plasma and have a phase velocity determined by the group velocity of the light pulse. Two important effects that can limit the acceleration distance and hence the net energy gain obtained by an electron are diffraction of the drive laser pulse and particle-wake dephasing. Diffraction of a focused ultrashort laser pulse can be overcome by using preformed plasma channels. The dephasing limit can be increased by operating at a lower plasma density, since this results in an increase in the laser group velocity. Here we present detailed results on the generation of GeV-class electron beams using an intense femtosecond laserbeam and a 3.3 cm long preformed discharge-based plasma channel [W. P. Leemans et al., Nature Physics2, 696 (2006)]. The use of a discharge-based waveguide permitted operation at an order of magnitude lower density and 15 times longer distance than in previous experiments that relied on laser preformed plasma channels. Laser pulses with peak power ranging from 10 – 40 TW were guided over more than 20 Rayleigh ranges and high quality electron beams with energy up to 1 GeV were obtained by channeling a 40 TW peak power laser pulse. The dependence of the electron beamcharacteristics on capillary properties,plasma density, and laser parameters are discussed.},

abstract = {We report on the highest precision yet achieved in the measurement of the polarization of a low-energy, Oð1 GeVÞ, continuous-wave (CW) electron beam, accomplished using a new polarimeter based on electron-photon scattering, in Hall C at Jefferson Lab. A number of technical innovations were necessary, including a novel method for precise control of the laser polarization in a cavity and a novel diamond microstrip detector that was able to capture most of the spectrum of scattered electrons. The data analysis technique exploited track finding, the high granularity of the detector, and its large acceptance. The polarization of the 180-$\mu$A, 1.16-GeV electron beam was measured with a statistical precision of {\textless} 1{\%} per hour and a systematic uncertainty of 0.59{\%}. This exceeds the level of precision required by the Q weak experiment, a measurement of the weak vector charge of the proton. Proposed future low-energy experiments require polarization uncertainty {\textless} 0.4{\%}, and this result represents an important demonstration of that possibility. This measurement is the first use of diamond detectors for particle tracking in an experiment. It demonstrates the stable operation of a diamond-based tracking detector in a high radiation environment, for two years.},

abstract = {A brief review is given of the implications of a 126 GeV Higgs boson for the discovery of supersymmetry. Thus a 126 GeV Higgs boson is problematic within the Standard Model because of vacuum instability pointing to new physics beyond the Standard Model. The problem of vacuum stability is overcome in the SUGRA GUT model but the 126 GeV Higgs mass implies that the average SUSY scale lies in the several TeV region. The largeness of the SUSY scale relieves the tension on SUGRA models since it helps suppress flavor changing neutral currents and CP violating effects and also helps in extending the proton life time arising from baryon and lepton number violating dimension five operators. The geometry of radiative breaking of the electroweak symmetry and fine tuning in view of the large SUSY scale are analyzed.Consistency with the Brookhaven {\$}g{\_}{\{}\backslashmu{\}}-2{\$} result is discussed. It is also shown that a large SUSY scale implied by the 126 GeV Higgs boson mass allows for light gauginos (gluino, charginos, neutralinos) and sleptons. These along with the lighter third generation squarks are the prime candidates for discovery at RUN II of the LHC. Implication of the 126 GeV Higgs boson for the direct search for dark matter is discussed. Also discussed are the sparticles mass hierarchies and their relationship with the simplified models under the Higgs boson mass constraint.},

abstract = {When an ultrarelativistic electron beam collides with a sufficiently intense laser pulse, radiation-reaction effects can strongly alter the beam dynamics. In the realm of classical electrodynamics, radiation reaction has a beneficial effect on the electron beam as it tends to reduce its energy spread. Here we show that when quantum effects become important, radiation reaction induces the opposite effect; i.e., the energy distribution of the electron beam spreads out after interacting with the laser pulse. We identify the physical origin of this opposite tendency in the intrinsic stochasticity of photon emission, which becomes substantial in the quantum regime. Our numerical simulations indicate that the predicted effects of the stochasticity can be measured already with presently available lasers and electron accelerators.},

abstract = {We present the results of kinetic modelling of quantum effects in laserbeam interaction. In the developed numerical model, electronpositron pair production by hard photons, hard photon emission and the electromagnetic fields generated by the created charged particles are taken into account. Interaction of a relativistic electron beam with a strong laser pulse is analyzed. It is shown that the quantum effects can be important even for moderately intense laser pulses when the number of emitted photons by single electron is not large. Electronpositron pair plasma production in extremely intense laser field via development of electromagnetic cascades is also studied. The simulation results confirm the prediction of strong laser field absorption in the self-generated electronpositron plasma. It is shown that the self-generated electronpositron plasma can be an efficient source of energetic gamma-quanta. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

The laser energy can be absorbed by electron-positron pair plasma produced from a seed by a strong laser field via the development of the electromagnetic cascades. The numerical model for a self-consistent study of electron-positron pair plasma dynamics is developed. Strong absorption of the laser energy in self-generated overdense electron-positron pair plasma is demonstrated.

We report here on early results arising from the development of a detailed numerical code modeling the proposed DARWIN detector, involving both liquid argon and xenon targets. We incorporate realistic detector physics, particle physics and astrophysical uncertainties and demonstrate to what extent two targets with similar sensitivities can remove various degeneracies and allow a determination of dark matter cross sections and masses while also probing rough aspects of the dark matter phase space distribution. We find that, even assuming dominance of spin-independent scattering, multi-ton scale experiments still have degeneracies that depend sensitively on the dark matter mass, and on the possibility of isospin violation and inelasticity in interactions. We find that these experiments are best able to discriminate dark matter properties for dark matter masses less than around 200 GeV. In addition, and somewhat surprisingly, the use of two targets gives only a small improvement (aside from the advantage of different systematics associated with any claimed signal) in the ability to pin down dark matter parameters when compared with one target of larger exposure.},

Upon ionization the gas target serves as a plasma mirror that reflects the incident pulse providing a counter-propagating electromagnetic wiggler. While plasma mirrors are often conceived as linear Fresnel reflectors, we demonstrate that for high-intensity, ultrashort laser pulses the reflection results from two distinct nonlinear mechanisms. At lower densities, the reflection arises from the emission of an electromagnetic pulse during the saturation of the absolute Raman instability at the quarter critical surface. At higher densities the reflection of the pulse from the critical surface sets up a density fluctuation that acts as a Bragg-like reflector. These mechanisms, occurring in a non-perturbative regime of laser–plasma interactions, are examined numerically in order to characterize the Compton scattered radiation.},

However, the use of conventional undulators using permanent magnets also implies system sizes which are large. In this work, we assess the possibilities for the use of novel mini-undulators in conjunction with a LWFA so that the dimensions of the undulator become comparable with the acceleration distances for LWFA experiments (i.e., centimeters). The use of a prototype undulator using laser machining of permanent magnets for this application is described and the emission characteristics and limitations of such a system are determined. Preliminary electron propagation and X-ray emission measurements are taken with a LWFA electron beam at the University of Michigan.},

abstract = {The ability to create matter from light is amongst the most striking predictions of quantum electrodynamics. Experimental signatures of this have been reported in the scattering of ultra-relativistic electron beams with laser beams, intense laser–plasma interactions and laser-driven solid target scattering. However, all such routes involve massive particles. The simplest mechanism by which pure light can be transformed into matter, Breit–Wheeler pair production ($\gamma$$\gamma$′ e+e−), has never been observed in the laboratory. Here, we present the design of a new class of photon–photon collider in which a gamma-ray beam is fired into the high-temperature radiation field of a laser-heated hohlraum. Matching experimental parameters to current-generation facilities, Monte Carlo simulations suggest that this scheme is capable of producing of the order of 105 Breit–Wheeler pairs in a single shot. This would provide the first realization of a pure photon–photon collider, representing the advent of a new type of high-energy physics experiment.},

abstract = {Many research and applications areas require photon sources capable of producing gamma-ray beams in the multi-MeV energy range with reasonably high fluxes and compact footprints. Besides industrial, nuclear physics and security applications, a considerable interest comes from the possibility to assess the state of conservation of cultural assets like statues, columns etc., via visualization and analysis techniques using high energy photon beams. Computed Tomography scans, widely adopted in medicine at lower photon energies, presently provide high quality three-dimensional imaging in industry and museums. We explore the feasibility of a compact source of quasi-monochromatic, multi-MeV gamma-rays based on Inverse Compton Scattering (ICS) from a high intensity ultra-violet (UV) beam generated in a free-electron laser by the electron beam itself. This scheme introduces a stronger relationship between the energy of the scattered photons and that of the electron beam, resulting in a device much more compact than a classic ICS for a given scattered energy. The same electron beam is used to produce gamma-rays in the 10–20 MeV range and UV radiation in the 10–15 eV range, in a {\~{}}4×22 m2footprint system.},

Abstract We report on the evaluation of the performance of self-guiding over extended distances with f 20 and f 40 focussing geometries. Guiding over 39 mm or more than 100 Rayleigh ranges was observed with the f 20 optic at n 1.5 10 cm e 18 3 -. Analysis of guiding performance found that the extent of the exiting laser spatial mode closely followed the matched spot size predicted by 3D nonlinear theory. Self-guiding with an f 40 optic was also characterised, with guided modes observed for a plasma length of 90 mm and a plasma density of n 9.5 10 cm e 17 3 -. This corresponds to self-guided propagation over 53 Rayleigh ranges and is similar to distances obtained with discharge plasma channel guiding.},

abstract = {The description of the dynamics of an electron in an external electromagnetic field of arbitrary intensity is one of the most fundamental outstanding problems in electrodynamics. Remarkably, to date there is no unanimously accepted theoretical solution for ultra-high intensities and little or no experimental data. The basic challenge is the inclusion of the self-interaction of the electron with the field emitted by the electron itself - the so-called radiation reaction force. We report here on the experimental evidence of strong radiation reaction, in an all-optical experiment, during the propagation of highly relativistic electrons (maximum energy exceeding 2 GeV) through the field of an ultra-intense laser (peak intensity of {\$}4\backslashtimes10{\^{}}{\{}20{\}}{\$} W/cm{\$}{\^{}}2{\$}). In their own rest frame, the highest energy electrons experience an electric field as high as one quarter of the critical field of quantum electrodynamics and are seen to lose up to 30{\%} of their kinetic energy during the propagation through the laser field. The experimental data show signatures of quantum effects in the electron dynamics in the external laser field, potentially showing departures from the constant cross field approximation.},

abstract = {Analytical calculations of radiative corrections in strong-field QED have hinted that in the presence of an intense plane wave the effective coupling of the theory in the high-energy sector may increase as the (2/3)-power of the energy scale. These findings have raised the question of their compatibility with the corresponding logarithmic increase of radiative corrections in QED in vacuum. However, all these analytical results in strong-field QED have been performed within the limiting case of a background constant crossed field. Starting from the polarization operator and the mass operator in a general plane wave, we show that the constant-crossed-field limit and the high-energy limit do not commute with each other and identify the physical parameter discriminating between the two alternative limits orders. As a result, we find that the power-law asymptotic scaling pertains strictly speaking only to the case of a constant-crossed-field background field, whereas high-energy radiative corrections in a general plane wave depend logarithmically on the energy scale as in vacuum. However, we also confirm the possibility of testing the "power-law" regime experimentally by means of realistic setups involving high-power lasers or high-density electron-positron bunches.},

abstract = {Expanding the scope of relativistic plasma research to wavelengths longer than the $\lambda$/≈ 0.8–1.1 $\mu$m range covered by conventional mode-locked solid-state lasers would offer attractive opportunities due to the quadratic scaling of the ponderomotive electron energy and critical plasma density with $\lambda$. Answering this quest, a next-generation mid-IR laser project is being advanced at the BNL ATF as a part of the user facility upgrade. We discuss the technical approach to this conceptually new 100 TW, 100 fs, $\lambda$ = 9–11 $\mu$m CO2 laser BESTIA (Brookhaven Experimental Supra-Terawatt Infrared at ATF) that encompasses several innovations applied for the rst time to molecular gas lasers. BESTIA will enable new regimes of laser plasma accelerators. One example is shock- wave ion acceleration (SWA) from gas jets. We review ongoing efforts to achieve stable, monoenergetic proton acceleration by dynamically shaping the plasma density pro le from a hydrogen gas target with laser-produced blast waves. At its full power, 100 TW BESTIA promises to achieve proton beams at an energy exceeding 200 MeV. In addition to ion acceleration in over-critical plasma, the ultra-intense mid-IR BESTIA will open up new opportunities in driving wake elds in tenuous plasmas, expanding the landscape of laser wake eld accelerator (LWFA) studies into the unexplored long- wavelength spectral domain. Simple wavelength scaling suggests that a 100 TW CO2 laser beam will be capable of ef ciently generating plasma ‘bubbles' a thousand times greater in volume compared with a near-IR solid state laser of an equivalent power. Combined with a femtosecond electron linac available at the ATF, this wavelength scaling will facilitate the study of external seeding and staging of LWFAs.},

These electron rings had 170-280 MeV energies with 5{\%}-25{\%} energy spread and ∼10  pC of charge and were observed over a range of plasma densities and compositions. Three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations show that laser intensity enhancement in the wake leads to sheath splitting and the formation of a hollow toroidal pocket in the electron density around the wake behind the first wake period. If the laser propagates over a distance greater than the ideal dephasing length, some of the dephasing electrons in the second period can become trapped within the pocket and form an ultrarelativistic electron ring that propagates in free space over a meter-scale distance upon exiting the plasma. Such a structure acts as a relativistic potential well, which has applications for accelerating positively charged particles such as positrons.},

Noteworthy is the particularly wide range of tube potentials (40-300 kVp) and anode angles (recommended: 6-30 degrees) that can be modelled: the program is therefore potentially of use to those working in superficial/orthovoltage radiotherapy, as well as diagnostic radiology.

Filtration can be applied for seven materials (air, water, Be, Al, Cu, Sn and W). In this note SpekCalc is described and illustrative examples are shown.

abstract = {A nearly monochromatic high-energy photon beam produced by Compton backscattering of ruby laser light has been used to study photoproduction in a hydrogen bubble chamber. The total hadronic yp cross sections at 1.44, 2.8, and 4.7 GeV are found to be 145.1+5.7, 131. 3+4.3, and 124.2+3.9 pb, respectively. Partial cross sections are presented also. In 1963 R. Milburn' concurrently with Arutyu-nian, Goldman, and Turnanian' pointed out that Compton backscattering of an intense polarized light beam by high-energy electrons would produce useful yields of monoenergetic polarized photons. Such a beam has been realized at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC)' and used together with the 82-in. Lawrence Radiation Laboratory-SLAC hydrogen bubble chamber for a study of yP interactions with linearly polarized photons. About 800 000 pictures have been taken at photon energies of 1.44, 2.8, and 4.7 GeV, 10{\%} of which have been used for the present study. Because the energy spread is small and because the bubble chamber permits a clear separation of electromagnetic and hadronic interactions, the exposures allow a straightforward measurement of the total hadronic yp cross section. Thus this measurement is free of the usual ba, ckground and detection biases caused by the 150-times more copious pair production.

An important feature of this code is the use of split-operator methods to integrate single-particle magnetic optics techniques with parallel PIC techniques. By choosing a splitting scheme that separates the self-fields from the complicated externally applied fields, we are able to utilize a large step size and still retain high accuracy. The method employed is symplectic and can be generalized to arbitrarily high order accuracy if desired. A two-dimensional parallel domain decomposition approach is employed within a message-passing programming paradigm along with a dynamic load balancing scheme. Performance tests on an SGI/Cray T3E-900 and an SGI Origin 2000 show good scalability of the object-oriented code. We present, as an example, a simulation of high current beam transport in the accelerator production of tritium (APT) linac design.},

abstract = {In order to investigate ponderomotive force in the relativistic regime, the interaction of ultraintense laser pulses with free electrons in vacuum is studied both theoretically and numerically. Various expressions for the electromagnetic field of the laser in the case of a Gaussian transverse profile are given, which take into account corrections to the monochromatic paraxial approximation, and the effects of finite pulse duration. A detailed demonstration of relativistic ponderomotive force (RPF) is established which makes apparent the domain of validity of this concept. Computer simulations are carried out using a three-dimensional test-particle code. They show the importance of the correct description of the fields, and confirm the domain of validity of the RPF which is 1-v(z)/c much greater than 1/kw(0), where v(z) is the component of the electron velocity parallel to the laser propagation direction, c is the velocity of light, k is the laser wave vector, and w(0) the beam waist at focus. Outside of this domain, the electron motion is more complicated, with a high sensitivity on the initial distance from the laser propagation axis and a relatively low energy gain.},

The flux of the scattered electrons is much lower than that of the photon beam and is additionally dispersed. This dispersal enables measurements while avoiding pileup, which is important in order to provide diagnostic information from intense ‘shot' based pulsed systems, such as those being built to leverage laser wakefield accelerators. Simulations indicate that the designed system is capable of resolving beam parameters from a single shot.

abstract = {The semi-classical heuristic emission formula of Baier-Katkov [Sov. Phys. JETP 26, 854 (1968)] is well-known to describe radiation of an ultrarelativistic electron in strong external fields employing the electron's classical trajectory. To find the limitations of the Baier-Katkov approach, we investigate electron radiation in a strong rotating electric field quantum mechanically using the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation. Except for an ultrarelativistic velocity, it is shown that an additional condition is required in order to recover the widely used semi-classical result. A violation of this condition leads to two consequences. First, it gives rise to qualitative discrepancy in harmonic spectra between the two approaches. Second, the quantum harmonic spectra are determined not only by the classical trajectory but also by the dispersion relation of the effective photons of the external field. In recent years the achievable intensities of both optical [1-3] and x-ray [4, 5] lasers are rapidly rising and a plethora of unexplored physical phenomena are expected to come within reach [6-14]. The fundamental theory describing these phenomena is strong-field QED. The strong field regime is characterized by a large nonlinearity parameter $\xi$ 1 [15], with $\xi$ ≡ ea/m = 7.5 I L /(10 20 W/cm 2)/$\omega$ [(eV))], where −e and m are the electron charge and mass, respectively, a is the amplitude of the laser vector potential A µ and I L , $\omega$ are the laser intensity and frequency, respectively. Relativistic units = c = 1 are used throughout. The Furry picture is commonly employed in strong field QED, when the strong electromagnetic field is considered as a classical field and is included in the free part of the Lagrangian [16]. As a consequence, the free particles in the standard QED perturbation theory are replaced with particles experiencing the external field. The rates of the scattering processes of electrons, positrons and photons in the presence of a laser field calculated in this framework [15, 17-28] depend upon $\xi$, as well as on the quantum parameter $\chi$ ≡ e m 3 −(F µ$\nu$ P $\nu$) 2 , where P $\nu$ is the kinetic momentum and F µ$\nu$ = ∂ µ A $\nu$ − ∂ $\nu$ A µ the field tensor. Especially successful is this formalism for field configurations which admit exact analytical solution for the electron wave function: plane wave (PW) [29], static electric field [30], static magnetic field [31, 32], and PW combined with a static magnetic field [33]. A real experiment, however, may involve complex field configurations, especially in plasma environment. A possible way to overcome this obstacle is to rely on the semi-classical (SC) method, introduced by Baier and Katkov [34, 35]. It allows one to calculate the emission quantum mechanical rate, including photon recoil effects, in general field configuration, given that the particle motion is quasiclassical and ultrarelativisitic. This method does not require the particle wave function, but only its classical trajectory in the given field configuration. In the ultrastrong field limit $\xi$ 1, a more simple Constant Crossed Field (CCF) approach is applicable [18, 36-38]. Recently, an approximation treating an ultrarelativistic electron interacting with a tightly focused laser beam has been proposed [39] and used for calculation the rates of QED processes in such fields [40-42]. Given the increasingly extreme and complex scenarios being explored with further rising laser intensities and frequencies, there is urgent need to investigate the limitation of the SC approximation. A relatively simple but not exactly solvable field configuration is the rotating electric field (REF), whose associated wave function was excessively studied [43-48]. Its physical significance stems from the fact that it describes a particle in the anti-node of a standing laser wave as well as a particle in a plasma wave (in a frame that moves with the wave group velocity). Recently, quantum calculations of the emitted radiation in this configuration have been carried out [49, 50], using different approximations for the wave function. In the present letter the quantum radiation emitted by a particle in a REF is calculated using the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) method, which is more accurate than the approaches employed so far for this scenario. The full quantum calculation of the radiation spectra is used as a benchmark for the SC approach. We demonstrate that a further condition is required except for an ultrarelativisitc motion: the $\gamma$-factor of the particle should be much larger than the non-linearity parameter $\xi$. As a test case, a particle moving in a circle in REF is studied. As the latter takes place when the initial momentum of the electron is vanishing, the condition $\gamma$ $\xi$ is violated, and the WKB and SC approaches yield different emission spectra. According to both models, the spectrum takes the form of discrete harmonics, but with qualitatively different harmonic structure (although, with the same harmonic-averaged spectrum). Moreover, the WKB model predicts a cutoff in the number of absorbed photons, while the SC model shows a semi-continuum in the high energy tail of the spectrum. As the circle-like electron's trajectory is also possible for a particle counterpropagating a PW laser with a certain initial momentum, we compare our emission spectrum to the latter case as well. For the PW (at $\xi$ 1), a continuous spectrum, coinciding with the CCF result, is predicted in contrast to the discrete spectrum in REF. The observed discrepancy indicates that the quantum emission spectrum cannot be fully determined by the electron's classical trajectory.},

abstract = {1 High-energy X-rays (HEX-rays) with photon energies on order of 100 keV have attractive characteristics, such as comparably low absorption, high spatial resolution and the ability to access inner-shell states of heavy atoms. These properties are advantageous for many applications ranging from studies of bulk materials to the investigation of materials in extreme conditions. Ultrafast X-ray diffraction allows the direct imaging of atomic dynamics simultaneously on its natural time and length scale. However, using HEX-rays for ultrafast studies has been limited due to the lack of sources that can generate pulses of sufficiently short (femtosecond) duration in this wavelength range. Here we show single-crystal diffraction using ultrashort {\~{}}90 keV HEX-ray pulses generated by an all-optical source based on inverse Compton scattering. We also demonstrate a method for measuring the crystal lattice spacing in a single shot that contains only {\~{}}10 5 photons in a spectral bandwidth of {\~{}}50{\%} full width at half maximum (FWHM). Our approach allows us to obtain structural information from the full X-ray spectrum. As target we use a cylindrically bent Ge crystal in Laue transmission geometry. This experiment constitutes a first step towards measurements of ultrafast atomic dynamics using femtosecond HEX-ray pulses. Experiments using HEX-rays with photon energies on order of 100 keV can access information that is comple-mentary to that obtained by lower-energy hard X-ray methods, which typically operate at photon energies around 10 keV. In particular, due to the comparatively low photo-absorption cross-section, HEX-rays have a high pene-tration depth which allows the investigation of bulk materials},

abstract = {Rising interest in inverse Compton sources has increased the need for efficient models that properly quantify the behavior of scattered radiation given a set of interaction parameters. The current state-of-the-art simulations rely on Monte Carlo–based methods, which, while properly expressing scattering behavior in high-probability regions of the produced spectra, may not correctly simulate such behavior in low-probability regions (e.g. tails of spectra). Moreover, sampling may take an inordinate amount of time for the desired accuracy to be achieved. In this paper, we present an analytic derivation of the expression describing the scattered radiation linewidth and propose a model to describe the effects of horizontal and vertical emittance on the properties of the scattered radiation. We also present an improved version of the code initially reported in Krafft et al. [Phys. Rev. Accel. Beams 19, 121302 (2016)], that can perform the same simulations as those present in CAIN and give accurate results in low-probability regions by integrating over the emissions of the electrons. Finally, we use these codes to carry out simulations that closely verify the behavior predicted by the analytically derived scaling law.},

If we specify a 2D initial structure, we observe a hexagonal structure for a high number of particles, corresponding to the close-packing of spheres in two dimensions. The two-dimensional structures are in agreement with the equilibrium slice model (ESM).},

Electron trajectories are calculated for the case of a plane electromagnetic wave of arbitrary intensity, either circularly or linearly polarized, interacting with a relativistic electron beam at an arbitrary interaction angle. The trajectories are used to derive analytic expressions for the intensity distribution of the scattered radiation. These expressions are valid in the nonlinear regime (arbitrary laser intensity) and include the generation of harmonics. The effect of interaction angle on the intensity distribution is discussed and spectra are plotted numerically for the specific cases of head-on and transverse scattering. The-dependence of x-ray frequency, pulse duration, and photon flux on interaction geometry are also examined. Applications to the laser synchrotron source are discussed. There are potential advantages of both head-on and transverse interaction geometries: headon scattering results in the generation of higher frequencies and higher photon fluxes; normal incidence scattering can result in ultrashort x-ray pulses.},

Interest in fields of this intensity dates back to the dawn of quantum electrodynamics, when Klein [i] observed the paradoxical possibility of passage of a Dirac electron through an arbitrarily high potential barrier, and Sauter [2] showed that the passage coefficient is exponentially small if the electric field intensity E inside the barrier is small compared with F0, and can be of the order of unity only at E-F0.

The observation of nonlinear quantum effects is therefore of fundamental interest, especially from the viewpoint of checking on the validity of quantum electrodynamics for fields of such intensity.

abstract = {We report direct high-resolution observation of nonlinear steepened plasma waves excited in the wake of an intense, self-pinched electron beam. Oscillations in both accelerating and deAecting fields are measured, and analyzed in the context of linear and nonlinear plasma-wave theory. The degree of nonlinearity in the wake fields is shown to be consistent with analytical predictions of the beam self-pinching. The impact of these results on plasma acceleration and focusing schemes {\&}s discussed. The plasma wake-field accelerator (PWFA), a promis-ing ultrahigh-gradient-acceleration scheme which uses longitudinal electric fields in plasma waves driven in the wake of a bunched relativistic electron beam, has been the subject of much recent experimental' and theoretical investigation. Much of the theoretical effort to date has concentrated on the linear regime of the PWFA, in which the amplitude of the sinusoidal electron density perturba-tions in the electron plasma waves n {\~{}} is much smaller than the ambient unperturbed plasma density no The pr.edom-inance of the linear theory is due to its usefulness — it al-lows calculation of the general three-dimensional varia-tion of the transverse and longitudinal wake fields if the driving electron-beam-current distribution is a known quantity, unchanging in time. Thus the standard linear treatment is inadequate to deal with large-amplitude plas-ma wake fields, and also ignores the self-pinching of the driver beam, an effect that has been proposed as a power-ful final focusing lens (plasma lens) for high-energy linear colliders. On the other hand, previous theoretical analyses of the nonlinear regime of the PWFA have treat-ed only the one-dimensional case, due to the mathematical complexity of the three-dimensional problem. The only previous experimental test of the PWFA was performed at the Argonne advanced accelerator test facili-ty' (AATF) with experimental conditions that satisfied the assumptions of both linear plasma response and negli-gible beam pinching. The experiments we report here, also performed at the AATF, were executed with much higher driving beam current densities present. These more intense beams undergo a self-pinch in the plasma, increasing the beam-current density further, which in turn increases the amplitude of the wake plasma waves into the nonlinear regime. For moderately nonlinear waves (the plasma electrons become only slightly relativistic), steepened wave profiles develop which can be decomposed into Fourier harmonics of the fundamental frequency, the plasma frequency re{\~{}} (4ne no/m,) '{\~{}} . Nonlinear beat-wave excited plasma waves have been indirectly observed by laser scattering off these harmonics in the electron den-sity perturbation" and predicted in computer simulations of plasma wake fields. We present below high-resolution measurements of both longitudinal and transverse plasma wake fields which show the clear signature of nonlinearity: steepening and harmonic generation.},

abstract = {Due to the interaction of physics and astrophysics we are witnessing in these years a splendid synthesis of theoretical, experimental and observational results originating from three fundamental physical processes. They were originally proposed by Dirac, by Breit and Wheeler and by Sauter, Heisenberg, Euler and Schwinger. For almost seventy years they have all three been followed by a continued effort of experimental verification on Earth-based experiments. The Dirac process, e+e-→2$\gamma$, has been by far the most successful. It has obtained extremely accurate experimental verification and has led as well to an enormous number of new physics in possibly one of the most fruitful experimental avenues by introduction of storage rings in Frascati and followed by the largest accelerators worldwide: DESY, SLAC etc. The Breit-Wheeler process, 2$\gamma$→e+e-, although conceptually simple, being the inverse process of the Dirac one, has been by far one of the most difficult to be verified experimentally. Only recently, through the technology based on free electron X-ray laser and its numerous applications in Earth-based experiments, some first indications of its possible verification have been reached. The vacuum polarization process in strong electromagnetic field, pioneered by Sauter, Heisenberg, Euler and Schwinger, introduced the concept of critical electric field Ec=me2c3/(eh{\{}stroke{\}}). It has been searched without success for more than forty years by heavy-ion collisions in many of the leading particle accelerators worldwide.The novel situation today is that these same processes can be studied on a much more grandiose scale during the gravitational collapse leading to the formation of a black hole being observed in Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs). This report is dedicated to the scientific race. The theoretical and experimental work developed in Earth-based laboratories is confronted with the theoretical interpretation of space-based observations of phenomena originating on cosmological scales. What has become clear in the last ten years is that all the three above mentioned processes, duly extended in the general relativistic framework, are necessary for the understanding of the physics of the gravitational collapse to a black hole. Vice versa, the natural arena where these processes can be observed in mutual interaction and on an unprecedented scale, is indeed the realm of relativistic astrophysics.We systematically analyze the conceptual developments which have followed the basic work of Dirac and Breit-Wheeler. We also recall how the seminal work of Born and Infeld inspired the work by Sauter, Heisenberg and Euler on effective Lagrangian leading to the estimate of the rate for the process of electron-positron production in a constant electric field. In addition to reviewing the intuitive semi-classical treatment of quantum mechanical tunneling for describing the process of electron-positron production, we recall the calculations in Quantum Electro-Dynamics of the Schwinger rate and effective Lagrangian for constant electromagnetic fields. We also review the electron-positron production in both time-alternating electromagnetic fields, studied by Brezin, Itzykson, Popov, Nikishov and Narozhny, and the corresponding processes relevant for pair production at the focus of coherent laser beams as well as electron-beam-laser collision. We finally report some current developments based on the general JWKB approach which allows us to compute the Schwinger rate in spatially varying and time varying electromagnetic fields.We also recall the pioneering work of Landau and Lifshitz, and Racah on the collision of charged particles as well as the experimental success of AdA and ADONE in the production of electron-positron pairs.We then turn to the possible experimental verification of these phenomena. We review: (A) the experimental verification of the e+e-→2$\gamma$ process studied by Dirac. We also briefly recall the very successful experiments of e+e-, annihilation to hadronic channels, in addition to the Dirac electromagnetic channel; (B) ongoing Earth-based experiments to detect electron-positron production in strong fields by focusing coherent laser beams and by electron-beam-laser collisions; and (C) the multiyear attempts to detect electron-positron production in Coulomb fields for a large atomic number Z{\textgreater}137 in heavy-ion collisions. These attempts follow the classical theoretical work of Popov and Zeldovich, and Greiner and their schools.We then turn to astrophysics. We first review the basic work on the energetics and electrodynamical properties of an electromagnetic black hole and the application of the Schwinger formula around Kerr-Newman black holes as pioneered by Damour and Ruffini. We only focus on black hole masses larger than the critical mass of neutron stars, for convenience assumed to coincide with the Rhoades and Ruffini upper limit of 3.2 M{\textperiodcentered}. In this case the electron Compton wavelength is much smaller than the space-time curvature and all previous results invariantly expressed can be applied following well established rules of the equivalence principle. We derive the corresponding rate of electron-positron pair production and introduce the concept of dyadosphere. We review the recent progress in describing the evolution of optically thick electron-positron plasma in the presence of supercritical electric field, which is relevant both in astrophysics as well as in ongoing laser beam experiments. In particular we review the recent progress based on the Vlasov-Boltzmann-Maxwell equations to study the feedback of the created electron-positron pairs on the original constant electric field. We evidence the existence of plasma oscillations and its interaction with photons leading to energy and number equipartition of photons, electrons and positrons. We finally review the recent progress obtained by using the Boltzmann equations to study the evolution of an electron-positron-photon plasma towards thermal equilibrium and determination of its characteristic timescales. The crucial difference introduced by the correct evaluation of the role of two- and three-body collisions, direct and inverse, is especially evidenced. We then present some general conclusions.The results reviewed in this report are going to be submitted to decisive tests in the forthcoming years both in physics and astrophysics. To mention only a few of the fundamental steps in testing in physics we recall, the setting up of experimental facilities at the National Ignition Facility at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory as well as the corresponding French Laser Mega Joule project. In astrophysics these results will be tested in galactic and extragalactic black holes observed in binary X-ray sources, active galactic nuclei, microquasars and in the process of gravitational collapse to a neutron star and also of two neutron stars to a black hole giving rise to GRBs. The astrophysical description of the stellar precursors and the initial physical conditions leading to a gravitational collapse process will be the subject of a forthcoming report. As of today no theoretical description has yet been found to explain either the emission of the remnant for supernova or the formation of a charged black hole for GRBs. Important current progress toward the understanding of such phenomena as well as of the electrodynamical structure of neutron stars, the supernova explosion and the theories of GRBs will be discussed in the above mentioned forthcoming report. What is important to recall at this stage is only that both the supernovae and GRBs processes are among the most energetic and transient phenomena ever observed in the Universe: a supernova can attain an energy of {\~{}}1054ergs on a timescale of a few months and GRBs can have emission of up to {\~{}}1054ergs in a timescale as short as a few seconds. The central role of neutron stars in the description of supernovae, as well as of black holes and the electron-positron plasma, in the description of GRBs, pioneered by one of us (RR) in 1975, are widely recognized. Only the theoretical basis to address these topics are discussed in the present report. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Narrow bandwidth, high energy photon sources can be generated by Thomson scattering of laser light from energetic electrons, and detailed control of the interaction is needed to produce high quality sources. We present analytic calculations of the energy-angular spectra and photon yield that parametrize the influences of the electron and laser beam parameters to allow source design. These calculations, combined with numerical simulations, are applied to evaluate sources using conventional scattering in vacuum and methods for improving the source via laser waveguides or plasma channels. We show that the photon flux can be greatly increased by using a plasma channel to guide the laser during the interaction. Conversely, we show that to produce a given number of photons, the required laser energy can be reduced by an order of magnitude through the use of a plasma channel. In addition, we show that a plasma can be used as a compact beam dump, in which the electron beam is decelerated in a short distance, thereby greatly reducing radiation shielding. Realistic experimental errors such as transverse jitter are quantitatively shown to be tolerable. Examples of designs for sources capable of performing nuclear resonance fluorescence and photofission are provided.},

This regime has been experimentally studied with the gemini laser using f/40 focusing optics in August 2015 and f/20 in 2008. The physical mechanisms and the scaling laws of electron acceleration achievable in a laser-plasma accelerator have been studied in the radially matched laser regime and thus are not accurate in the strongly mismatched regime explored here. In this work, we show that a novel adjusted-a0 model applicable over a specific range of densities where the laser enters the state of a strong optical shock, describes the mismatched regime. Beside several novel aspects of laser-plasma interaction dynamics relating to an elongating bubble shape and the corresponding self-injection mechanism, importantly we find that in this strongly mismatched regime when the laser pulse transforms into an optical shock it is possible to achieve beam-energies that significantly exceed the incident intensity matched regime scaling laws.},

In this regime the radial envelope of a laser-pulse incident at the plasma entrance is mismatched to the nonlinear electron response excited by it, in contrast to the established understanding. A nonlinear laser envelope equation is derived to show that as the strength of the mismatch is increased, the envelope oscillations steepen and become increasingly asymmetric, exhibiting shorter and tighter radial squeeze phases. The sharply increasing intensity in a shortened squeeze phase results in the slicing of the longitudinal laser envelope, driving a strong optical-shock. The optical shock results in an elongating bubble shape with significantly higher peak plasma fields and a novel self-injection mechanism which produces beams of high transverse qualities. The behavior of peak beam energies from Particle-In-Cell simulations and self-guided multi-GeV experimental data are in good agreement with the predictions of an adjusted-{\$}a{\_}0{\$} model and significantly exceed the matched regime predictions.},

abstract = {A strongly mismatched regime of self-guided laser-plasma acceleration is revealed to be favored by a wide-range of groundbreaking experiments and thus examined. The strong mismatch, in contrast with the matched condition, arises from the incident laser spot-size being much larger than that needed for equilibration of the laser ponderomotive and electron-ion charge-separation force. A nonlinear envelope equation is used to model the steepening of laser radial envelope oscillations. In a steepened squeeze phase, rapid increase in laser intensity leads to the slicing of laser into a strong optical-shock state. As a response to the optical-shock state the acceleration structure elongates rapidly which self-injects high-quality beams. The prominent signatures of the mismatched regime, strong optical-shock excitation and bubble elongation, are validated using multi-dimensional Particle-In-Cell simulations. This work thus uncovers a generalized regime that has been favored by many laser-plasma acceleration experiments and opens a novel pathway for future investigations.},

abstract = {An all-optical centimeter-scale laser-plasma positron accelerator is modeled to produce quasimonoe-nergetic beams with tunable ultrarelativistic energies. A new principle elucidated here describes the trapping of divergent positrons that are part of a laser-driven electromagnetic particle-shower with a large energy spread and their acceleration into a quasimonoenergetic positron beam in a laser-driven plasma wave. Proof of this principle using analysis and particle-in-cell simulations demonstrates that, under limits defined here, existing lasers can accelerate hundreds of MeV pC quasi-monoenergetic positron bunches. By providing an affordable alternative to kilometer-scale radio-frequency accelerators, this compact positron accelerator opens up new avenues of research. Monoenergetic positron accelerators intrinsic to positron-electron (e þ − e −) colliders at energy frontiers [1,2] have been fundamental to many important discoveries [3-6] that underpin the standard model. Apart from high-energy physics (HEP), monoenergetic e þ-beams of mostly sub-MeV energies are also used in many areas of material science [7,8], medicine [9] and applied antimatter physics [10]. Applications have however not had ready access to positron accelerators and have had to rely on alternative sources such as $\beta$ þ-decay [11], (p,n) reaction [12] and pair-production [13] of MeV-scale photons from-fission reactors [14], neutron-capture reactions [15] or MeV-scale e −-beams impinging on a high-Z target [16]. Positron accelerators have evidently been scarce due to complexities involved in the production and isolation of elusive particles like positrons [2,16] in addition to the costs associated with the large size of radio-frequency (rf) accelerators [17]. The size of conventional rf accelerators is dictated by the distance over which charged particles gain energy under the action of breakdown limited [18] tens of MVm −1 rf fields sustained using metallic structures that reconfigure transverse electromagnetic waves into modes with axial fields. This limit also complicates efficient positron production [2,13], which has required a multi-GeV e −-beam from a kilometer-scale rf accelerator [17] to interact with a target. Furthermore, the positrons thus produced have to be captured in a flux concentrator, turned around and transported back [19] for reinjection into the same rf accelerator. Advancements in rf technologies have demonstrated 100 MVm −1-scale fields [20] but explorations beyond the standard model at TeV-scale e þ − e − center-of-mass energies still remain unviable. Moreover, the progress of non-HEP applications of e þ-beams has been largely stagnant. Recent efforts on compact and affordable positron accelerator design based on advanced acceleration techniques [21,22] have unfortunately been unsatisfactory.

abstract = {We study the long-term evolution (LTE) of plasma wakefields over multiple plasma-electron periods and few plasma-ion periods, much less than a recombination time. The evolution and relaxation of such a wakefield-perturbed plasma over these timescales has important implications for the upper limits of repetition-rates in plasma colliders. Intense fields in relativistic lasers (or intense beams) create plasma wakefields (modes around {\{}$\backslash$omega{\}}pe) by transferring energy to the plasma electrons. Charged-particle beams in the right phase may be accelerated with acceleration/focusing gradients of tens of GeV/m. However, wakefields leave behind a plasma not in equilibrium, with a relaxation time of multiple plasma-electron periods. Ion motion over ion timescales, caused by energy transfer from the driven plasma-electrons to the plasma-ions can create interesting plasma states. Eventually during LTE, the dynamics of plasma de-coheres (multiple modes through instability driven mixing), thermalizing into random motion (second law of thermodynamics), dissipating energy away from the wakefields. Wakefield-drivers interacting with such a relativistically hot-plasma lead to plasma wakefields that differ from the wakefields in a cold-plasma.},

abstract = {We model the trapping of plasma {\$}e{\^{}}-{\$} within the density structures excited by a propagating energy source ({\$}\backslashbeta{\_}{\{}S{\}}\backslashsimeq1{\$}) in a rising plasma density gradient. Rising density gradient leads to spatially contiguous coupled up-chirped plasmons ({\$}d{\{}\backslashomega{\^{}}2{\_}{\{}pe{\}}(x){\}}/{\{}dx{\}}{\textgreater}0{\$}). Therefore phase mixing between plasmons can lead to trapping until the plasmon field is high enough such that {\$}e{\^{}}-{\$} trajectories returning towards a longer wavelength see a trapping potential. Rising plasma density gradients are ubiquitous for confining the plasma within sources at the vacuum-plasma interfaces. Therefore trapping of plasma-{\$}e{\^{}}-{\$} in a rising ramp is important for acceleration diagnostics and to understand the energy dissipation from the excited plasmon train $\backslash$cite{\{}LTE-2013{\}}. Down-ramp in density $\backslash$cite{\{}density-transition-2001{\}} has been used for plasma-{\$}e{\^{}}-{\$} trapping within the first bucket behind the driver. Here, in rising density gradient the trapping does not occur in the first plasmon bucket but in subsequent plasmon buckets behind the driver. Trapping reduces the Hamiltonian of each bucket where {\$}e{\^{}}-{\$} are trapped, so it is a wakefield-decay probe. Preliminary computational results for beam and laser-driven wakefield are shown.},

abstract = {Inverse Compton scattering of laser photons by ultrarelativistic electron beam provides polarized x-to $\gamma$-ray pulses due to the Doppler blueshifting. Nonlinear electrodynamics in the relativistically intense linearly polarized laser field changes the radiation kinetics established during the Compton interaction. These are due to the induced figure-8 motion, which introduces an overall redshift in the radiation spectrum, with the concomitant emission of higher order harmonics. To experimentally analyze the strong field physics associated with the nonlinear electron-laser interaction, clear modifications to the angular and wavelength distributions of x rays are observed. The relativistic photon wave field is provided by the ps CO 2 laser of peak normalized vector potential of 0.5 {\textless} a L {\textless} 0.7, which due to the quadratic dependence of the strength of nonlinear phenomena on a L permits sufficient effects not observed in past 2nd harmonic study with a L ≈ 0.3 laser [M. Babzien et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 054802 (2006)]. The angular spectral characteristics are revealed using K-, Ledge , and high energy attenuation filters. The observation indicates existence of the electrons' longitudinal motion through frequency redshifting understood as the mass shift effect. Thus, the 3rd harmonic radiation has been observed containing on-axis x-ray component that is directly associated with the induced figure-8 motion. These are further supported by an initial evidence of off-axis 2nd harmonic radiation produced in a circularly polarized laser wave field. Total x-ray photon number per pulse, scattered by 65 MeV electron beam of 0.3 nC, at the interaction point is measured to be approximately 10 9 .},

Neglecting the radiation reaction, the equations of motion for an electron in an arbitrarily intense, elliptically polarized, plane electromagnetic wave can be solved exactly. From the solutions for the electron motion, the radiated power, momentum, and harmonics are calculated in two special Lorentz frames: the laboratory frame and the frame in which the electron is on the average at rest. The difference between the radiated power measured by an observer and that emitted by the electron is discussed for each frame. A sum rule for the radiated harmonics is derived. The limitation due to the neglect of radiation reaction is considered. Finally, the high- and low-intensity behavior of the spectrum and angular distribution of the radiation is analyzed in both frames.},

abstract = {Electron-positron pair plasmas represent a unique state of matter, whereby there exists an intrinsic and complete symmetry between negatively charged (matter) and positively charged (antimatter) particles. These plasmas play a fundamental role in the dynamics of ultra-massive astrophysical objects and are believed to be associated with the emission of ultra-bright gamma-ray bursts. Despite extensive theoretical modelling, our knowledge of this state of matter is still speculative, owing to the extreme difficulty in recreating neutral matter-antimatter plasmas in the laboratory. Here we show that, by using a compact laser-driven setup, ion-free electron-positron plasmas with unique characteristics can be produced. Their charge neutrality (same amount of matter and antimatter), high-density and small divergence finally open up the possibility of studying electron-positron plasmas in controlled laboratory experiments.},

These mechanisms are routinely used to generate positron beams in conventional accelerators such as the electron–positron collider (LEP). Here we show that the application of similar physical mechanisms to a laser- driven electron source allows for the generation of high-quality positron beams in a much more compact and cheaper configuration. We anticipate that the application of these results to the next generation of lasers might open the pathway for the realization of an all-optical high-energy electron–positron collider.},

abstract = {We report on recent experimental results concerning the generation of collimated (divergence of the order of a few mrad) ultra-relativistic positron beams using a fully optical system. The positron beams are generated exploiting a quantum-electrodynamic cascade initiated by the propagation of a laser-accelerated, ultra-relativistic electron beam through high-Z solid targets. As long as the target thickness is comparable to or smaller than the radiation length of the material, the divergence of the escaping positron beam is of the order of the inverse of its Lorentz factor. For thicker solid targets the divergence is seen to gradually increase, due to the increased number of fundamental steps in the cascade, but it is still kept of the order of few tens of mrad, depending on the spectral components in the beam. This high degree of collimation will be fundamental for further injection into plasma-wakefield afterburners.},

The contribution to the count rate due to the stream cuts off at some characteristic energy. Near this cutoff energy, the stream contribution to the annual modulation of recoils in the detector is comparable to that of the thermalized halo, even if the stream represents only a small portion (∼ 5 {\%} or less) of the local halo density. Consequently the total modulation may be quite different than would be expected for the standard halo model alone: it may not be cosine-like and can peak at a different date than expected. The annual modulation of this cutoff energy together with the annual modulation of the overall signal provide a "smoking gun" for WIMP detection. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Ultrashort light pulses are powerful tools for time-resolved studies of molecular and atomic dynamics1. They arise in the visible and infrared range from femtosecond lasers2, and at shorter wavelengths, in the ultraviolet and X-ray range, from synchrotron sources3 and free-electron lasers4. Recent progress in laser wakefield accelerators has resulted in electron beams with energies from tens of mega-electron volts (refs 5,6,7) to more than 1 GeV within a few centimetres8, with pulse durations predicted to be several femtoseconds9. The enormous progress in improving beam quality and stability5, 6, 7, 8, 10 makes them serious candidates for driving the next generation of ultracompact light sources11. Here, we demonstrate the first successful combination of a laser-plasma wakefield accelerator, producing 55–75 MeV electron bunches, with an undulator to generate visible synchrotron radiation. By demonstrating the wavelength scaling with energy, and narrow-bandwidth spectra, we show the potential for ultracompact and versatile laser-based radiation sources from the infrared to X-ray energies.},

In order to inject electrons into the accelerating phase of the plasma wave, a sharp downward density transition is employed. Prior to ionization by the laser pulse this transition is formed by a shock front induced by a knife edge inserted into a supersonic gas jet. With laser pulses of 8fs duration and with only 65mJ energy on target, the accelerator produces a monoenergetic electron beam with tunable energy between 15 and 25MeV and on average 3.3pC charge per electron bunch. The shock-front injector is a simple and powerful new tool to enhance the reproducibility of laser-driven electron accelerators, is easily adapted to different laser parameters, and should therefore allow scaling to the energy range of several hundred MeV.},

abstract = {Laser-plasma particle accelerators could provide more compact sources of high-energy radiation than conventional accelerators. Moreover, because they deliver radiation in femtosecond pulses, they could improve the time resolution of X-ray absorption techniques. Here we show that we can measure and control the polarization of ultra-short, broad-band keV photon pulses emitted from a laser-plasma-based betatron source. The electron trajectories and hence the polarization of the emitted X-rays are experimentally controlled by the pulse-front tilt of the driving laser pulses. Particle-in-cell simulations show that an asymmetric plasma wave can be driven by a tilted pulse front and a non-symmetric intensity distribution of the focal spot. Both lead to a notable off-axis electron injection followed by collective electron-betatron oscillations. We expect that our method for an all-optical steering is not only useful for plasma-based X-ray sources but also has significance for future laser-based particle accelerators.},

Transverse oscillations in the accelerated electron orbits produce betatron radiation. The electron motion and the resulting betatron radiation spectrum can therefore be controlled by shaping the plasma density along the orbit of the electrons. Here, a method based on the use of a plasma with a longitudinal density variation (density depression or step) is proposed to increase the transverse oscillation amplitude and the energy of the electrons accelerated in a wakefield cavity. For fixed laser parameters, by appropriately tailoring the plasma profile, the betatron radiation emitted by these electrons is significantly increased in both flux and energy.

For time-resolved pump-probe ex-periments, future operation modes by means of laser seed-ing and for special diagnostic measurements it is crucial to synchronize various laser systems to the electron beam with an long-term stability of better than 30 fs. For this purpose an optical synchronization system is currently be-ing installed and tested at FLASH. In this paper, we report on the progress of the develop-ment of a background-free optical cross-correlation scheme to synchronize two individual mode-locked laser systems of different center wavelengths and repetition rates with an accuracy of better than 10 fs. The scheme is being tested by linking a commercial Ti:sapphire oscillator, used for electro-optical diagnostics at FLASH, to a locally installed erbium-doped fiber laser. Later, this laser will be replaced by an end-point of an actively length-stabilized fiber-link distributing the pulses from the master laser oscillator of the machine to lock the diagnostics laser to the optical syn-chronization system.},

Here we achieve all-optical synchronization at the soft X-ray free-electron laser FLASH and demonstrate facility-wide timing to better than 30 fs r.m.s. for 90 fs X-ray photon pulses. Crucially, our analysis indicates that the performance of this optical synchronization is limited primarily by the free-electron laser pulse duration, and should naturally scale to the sub-10 femtosecond level with shorter X-ray pulses.},

abstract = {Few studies have assessed the impact of binary systems on the fundamental mathematical models that describe drug permeation. The aim of this work was to determine the influence of varying the proportions of prilocaine and lidocaine in a binary saturated solution on mass transfer across synthetic membranes. Infinite-dose permeation studies were performed using Franz diffusion cells with either regenerated cellulose or silicone membranes, and partition coefficients were determined by drug loss over 24 h. There was a linear relationship between the flux of prilocaine and lidocaine through regenerated cellulose membrane (R 2 ≥ 0.985, n = 5) and their normalised ratio in solution. This linear model was also applicable for the permeation of prilocaine through silicone membrane (R 2 = 0.991, n = 5), as its partition coefficient was independent of the drug ratio (15.84 ± 1.41). However, the partition coefficient of lidocaine increased from 27.22 ± 1.68 to 47.03 ± 3.32 as the ratio of prilocaine increased and this resulted in a non-linear relationship between permeation and drug ratio. Irrespective of the membrane used, the permeation of one drug from a binary system was hindered by the presence of the second, which could be attributed to a reduction in available membrane diffusion volume. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors.},

abstract = {This paper is based on the elementary remark that the extraction of gauge invariant results from a formally gauge invariant theory is ensured if one employs methods of solution that involve only gauge covariant quantities. We illustrate this statement in connection with the problem of vacuum polarization by a prescribed electromagnetic 6eld. The vacuum current of a charged Dirac field, which can be expressed in terms of the Green's function of that field, implies an addition to the action integral of the electromagnetic field. Now these quantities can be related to the dynamical properties of a "particle" with space-time coordinates that depend upon a proper-time parameter. The proper-time equations of motion involve only electromagnetic 6eld strengths, and provide a suitable gauge invariant basis for treating problems. Rigorous solutions of the equations of motion can be obtained for a constant Geld, and for a plane wave 6eld. A renormalization of 6eld strength and charge, applied to the modi6ed lagrange function for constant fields, yields a finite, gauge invariant result which implies nonlinear properties for the electromagnetic 6eld in the vacuum. The contribution of a zero spin charged 6eld is also stated. After the same 6eld strength renormalization, the modified physical quantities describing a plane wave in the vacuum reduce to just those of the maxwell field; there are no nonlinear phenomena for a single plane wave, of arbitrary strength and spectral composition. The results obtained for constant (that is, slowly varying fields), are then applied to treat the two-photon disintegration of a spin zero neutral meson arising from the polarization of the proton vacuum. We obtain approximate, gauge invariant expressions for the effective interaction between the meson and the electromagnetic field, in which the nuclear coupling may be scalar, pseudoscalar, or pseudovector in nature. The direct veri6cation of equivalence between the pseudoscalar and pseudovector interactions only requires a proper statement of the limiting processes involved. For arbitrarily varying 6elds, perturbation methods can be applied to the equations of motion, as discussed in Appendix A, or one can employ an expansion in powers of the potential vector. The latter automatically yields gauge invariant results, provided only that the proper-time integration is reserved to the last. This indicates that the sjgnificant aspect of the proper-time method is its isolation of divergences in integrals with respect to the proper-time parameter, which is independent of the coordinate system and of the gauge. The connection between the proper-time method and the technique of "invariant regularization" is discussed. Incidentally, the probability of actual pair creation is obtained from the imaginary part of the electromagnetic 6eld action integral. Finally, as an application of the Green's function for a constant Geld, we construct the mass operator of an electron in a weak, homogeneous external field, and derive the additional spin magnetic moment of a/2m magnetons by means of a perturbation calculation in which proper-mass plays the customary role of energy.},

abstract = {Electron-bunch diagnostics are desired to utilize unambiguous, non-destructive, single-shot techniques. Various methods fulfill the latter two demands, but feature significant ambiguities and constraints in the reconstruction of time-domain electron-bunch profiles, e.g. uncertainties arising from the phase retrieval of coherent radiation using the Kramers–Kronig relation. We present a novel method of measuring the spectral phase. The measurement is based on upconversion in an electro-optic crystal, where the THz-field spectrum of fs-electron bunches is shifted to the near-infrared. This technique allows the single-shot detection of its longitudinal form factor in both, amplitude and phase. The spectral phase and amplitude information is measured and thus the temporal profile reconstructed using temporal analysis by dispersing a pair of light E-fields, also known as TADPOLE. This is a combination of frequency resolved optical gating (FROG) and spectral interferometry, enabling the temporal measurement of low-power laser pulses. In this procedure, a narrow-bandwidth laser pulse detecting the longitudinal variations in the transverse electric field of an electron bunch via frequency mixing is interfered with a broadband and FROG-characterized reference pulse. The longitudinal beam profile may therefore be unambiguously inferred from the generated interferogram and the detected spectral-phase-information of the reference pulse.},

A long-term difficulty associated with laser-plasma acceleration--the very broad, exponential energy spectrum of the emitted particles--has been overcome recently for electron beams. Here we report analogous results for ions, specifically the production of quasi-monoenergetic proton beams using laser-plasma accelerators. Reliable and reproducible laser-accelerated ion beams were achieved by intense laser irradiation of solid microstructured targets. This proof-of-principle experiment serves to illuminate the role of laser-generated plasmas as feasible particle sources.

abstract = {Radiative polarization of electrons and positrons through the Sokolov-Ternov effect is important for applications in high-energy physics. Radiative spin-polarization is a manifestation of quantum radiation reaction affecting the spin-dynamics of electrons. We recently proposed that an analogue of the Sokolov-Ternov effect could occur in the strong electromagnetic fields of ultra-high-intensity lasers, which would result in a build-up of spin-polarization in femtoseconds. In this paper we develop a density matrix formalism for describing beam polarization in strong electromagnetic fields. We start by using the density matrix formalism to study spin-flips in non-linear Compton scattering and its dependence on the initial polarization state of the electrons. Numerical calculations show a radial polarization of the scattered electron beam in a circularly polarized laser, and we find azimuthal asymmetries in the polarization patterns for ultra-short laser pulses. A degree of polarization approaching 9 {\%} is achieved after emitting just a single photon. We develop the theory by deriving a local constant crossed field approximation (LCFA) for the polarization density matrix, which is a generalization of the well known LCFA scattering rates. We find spin-dependent expressions that may be included in electromagnetic charged-particle simulation codes, such as particle-in-cell plasma simulation codes, using Monte-Carlo modules. In particular, these expressions include the spin-flip rates for arbitrary initial polarization of the electrons. The validity of the LCFA is confirmed by explicit comparison with an exact QED calculation of electron polarization in an ultrashort laser pulse.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 American Physical Society. Narrowband x- and $\gamma$-ray sources based on the inverse Compton scattering of laser pulses suffer from a limitation of the allowed laser intensity due to the onset of nonlinear effects that increase their bandwidth. It has been suggested that laser pulses with a suitable frequency modulation could compensate this ponderomotive broadening and reduce the bandwidth of the spectral lines, which would allow one to operate narrowband Compton sources in the high-intensity regime. In this paper we therefore present the theory of nonlinear Compton scattering in a frequency-modulated intense laser pulse. We systematically derive the optimal frequency modulation of the laser pulse from the scattering matrix element of nonlinear Compton scattering, taking into account the electron spin and recoil. We show that, for some particular scattering angle, an optimized frequency modulation completely cancels the ponderomotive broadening for all harmonics of the backscattered light. We also explore how sensitively this compensation depends on the electron-beam energy spread and emittance, as well as the laser focusing.},

abstract = {Scattering of ultraintense short laser pulses off relativistic electrons allows one to generate a large number of X-or gamma-ray photons with the expense of the spectral width-temporal pulsing of the laser inevitable leads to considerable spectral broadening. In this Letter, we describe a simple method to generate optimized laser pulses that compensate the nonlinear spectrum broadening, and can be thought of as a superposition of two oppositely linearly chirped pulses delayed with respect to each other. We develop a simple analytical model that allow us to predict the optimal parameters of such a two-pulse-the delay, amount of chirp and relative phase-for generation of a narrowband $\gamma$-ray spectrum. Our predictions are confirmed by numerical optimization and simulations including 3D effects. The Inverse Compton Scattering (ICS) of laser light off high-energy electron beams is a well-established source of X-and gamma-rays for applications in medical, biological , nuclear, and material sciences [1-9]. One of the main advantages of ICS photon sources is the possibility to generate narrowband MeV photon beams, as opposed to a broad continuum of Bremsstrahlung sources, for instance. The radiation from 3rd and 4th generation light-sources, on the other hand, typically has their highest brightness at much lower photon energies [3], giving ICS sources their unique scope [10-12]. With laser plasma accelerators (LPA), stable GeV-level electron beams have been produced with very high peak currents, small source size, intrinsic short duration (few 10s fs) and temporal correlation with the laser driver [13-15], which is beneficial for using them in compact all-optical ICS. In particular the latter properties allow for the generation of femtosecond gamma-rays that can be useful in time-resolved (pump-probe) studies. For designing narrowband sources, it is important to understand in detail the different contributions to the scattered radiation bandwidth [6, 9, 16, 17]. For an intense source the number of electron-photon scattering events needs to be maximized [6], which can be achieved in the most straightforward way by increasing the intensity of the scattering laser, I[W/cm 2 ] = 1.37 × 10 18 a 2 0 /$\lambda$ 2 [µm], where a 0 = eA 0 /m with e and m electron absolute charge and mass respectively, and A 0 the peak amplitude of the laser pulse vector potential in Gaussian CGS units (with = c = 1) and $\lambda$ the laser wavelength. However, this leads to an unfortunate consequence when the laser pulse normalized amplitude reaches a 0 ∼ 1: ponderomotive spectral broadening of the scattered radiation on the order of ∆$\omega$ /$\omega$ ∼ a 2 0 / 1 + a 2 0 [6, 16, 18-21]. The ponderomotive broadening is caused by the v × B force, which effectively slows down the forward motion of electrons near the peak of the laser pulse where the intensity is high [19, 20, 22]. Hence, the photons scattered near the peak of the laser pulse are red-shifted compared to the photons scattered near the wings of the pulse and the spectrum of gamma rays becomes broad. Broadband gamma-ray spectra from ICS using laser-accelerated electrons and scattering pulses with a 0 {\textgreater} 1 have been observed experimentally [23-26]. To overcome this fundamental limit it was proposed to use temporal laser pulse chirping to compensate the nonlinear spectrum broadening [27-31]. By performing a stationary phase analysis of the non-linear Comp-ton S-matrix elements [29] or the corresponding classical Li{\'{e}}nard-Wiechert amplitudes [28, 30] one finds that the fundamental frequency of on-axis ICS photons behaves as (off-axis emission and higher harmonics can be easily accounted for [29]). $\omega$ (ϕ) = 4$\gamma$ 2 $\omega$ L 1 + a(ϕ) 2 + 2$\gamma$$\omega$ L m , (1) where the last term in the denominator is the quantum recoil and missing in a classical approach. Here a(ϕ) is the envelope of the normalized laser pulse vector potential , with peak value a 0 , $\omega$ L as the laser frequency, and ϕ = t − z. If the instantaneous laser frequency follows the laser pulse envelope according to $\omega$ L (ϕ) = $\omega$ 0 [1 + a(ϕ) 2 ] , (2) with a reference frequency $\omega$ 0 , then the non-linear broadening is perfectly compensated, $\omega$ = const. ≈ 4$\gamma$ 2 $\omega$ 0 in the recoil free limit. This is the basic idea behind the promising approach for ponderomotive broadening compensation in ICS using chirped laser pulses. However, realizing such a highly nonlinear temporal chirp experimentally seems challenging because the laser frequency needs to precisely sweep up and down again within a few femtoseconds [28, 31].},

@article{Shalloo2019a,
abstract = {We demonstrate optical guiding of high-intensity laser pulses in long, low density hydrodynamic optical-field-ionized (HOFI) plasma channels. An axicon lens is used to generate HOFI plasma channels with on-axis electron densities as low as ne(0) = 1.5 × 10 17 cm −3 and matched spot sizes in the range 20 µm WM 40 µm. Control of these channel parameters via adjustment of the initial cell pressure and the delay after the arrival of the channel-forming pulse is demonstrated. For laser pulses with a peak axial intensity of 4 × 10 17 W cm −2 , highly reproducible, high-quality guiding over more than 14 Rayleigh ranges is achieved at a pulse repetition rate of 5 Hz, limited by the available channel-forming laser and vacuum pumping system. Plasma channels of this type would seem to be well suited to multi-GeV laser wakefield accelerators operating in the quasi-linear regime. Many applications of high-intensity laser-plasma interactions require the propagation of high-intensity laser pulses through plasmas which are orders of magnitude longer than the Rayleigh range. One example of particular current interest is the laser wakefield accelerator (LWFA) [1], in which a laser pulse with an intensity of order 10 18 W cm −2 propagates though a plasma, driving a trailing density wave. The electric fields generated within this plasma wave are of the order of the wave-breaking field E 0 = m e $\omega$ p c/e, where $\omega$ p = (n e e 2 /m e ǫ 0) 1/2 and n e is the electron density [2, 3]. For plasma densities in the range n e = 10 17 −10 18 cm −3 , E 0 ≈ 30 − 100 GV m −1 , which is several orders of magnitude higher than the fields generated in radio-frequency machines. Plasma accelerators can drive compact sources of femtosecond-duration [4-6] radiation via betatron emission [7, 8], undulator radiation [9, 10], and Thompson scattering [11-13], with many potential applications in ultrafast science. In the longer term they could provide a building block for future high-energy particle colliders [14]. For LWFAs operating in the quasilinear regime [2], the energy gain per stage varies as W ∝ E 0 L acc ∝ 1/n e , and the required length of the stage varies as L acc ∝ 1/n 3/2 e. Hence reaching higher energy gains requires the drive laser to propagate over longer lengths of lower density plasma. To date the highest reported electron energy generated in a LWFA is 4.2 GeV, which was achieved by guiding intense laser pulses through a 90 mm long plasma channel with an axial electron density of 7 × 10 17 cm −3 [15].},

It is found that there is no shift in the position of fluorescence maxima, but the intensity decreases with increasing temperature, which depends on the polarity of the solvent. A mechanism of fluorescence quenching with rise in temperature is discussed in terms of the relative location of lowest ($\pi$$\pi$*) (n$\pi$*) states and the energy difference between them. The change in temperature brings about a change in the probabilities of radiative and nonradiative transition. The nonradiative deactivation of excited states in the absence of a quencher is temperature dependent and its thermal activation energy has been determined. {\textcopyright} 2013 Published by NRC Research Press.},

abstract = {We have investigated the role that the transverse electric field of the laser plays in the acceleration of electrons in a laser wakefield accelerator (LWFA) operating in the quasi-blowout regime through particle-in-cell code simulations. In order to ensure that longitudinal compression and/or transverse focusing of the laser pulse is not needed before the wake can self-trap the plasma electrons, we have employed the ionization injection technique. Furthermore, the plasma density is varied such that at the lowest densities, the laser pulse occupies only a fraction of the first wavelength of the wake oscillation (the accelerating bucket), whereas at the highest density, the same duration laser pulse fills the entire first bucket. Although the trapped electrons execute betatron oscillations due to the ion column in all cases, at the lowest plasma density they do not interact with the laser field and the energy gain is all due to the longitudinal wakefield. However, as the density is increased, there can be a significant contribution to the maximum energy due to direct laser acceleration (DLA) of those electrons that undergo betatron motion in the plane of the polarization of the laser pulse. Eventually, DLA can be the dominant energy gain mechanism over acceleration due to the longitudinal field at the highest densities.},

Previous work has demonstrated the use of a plasma mirror (PM), after a laser-plasma accelerator (LPA), for generating Compton $\gamma$-rays by retro-reflecting the spent laser pulse into the just-accelerated electrons. Here, we investigate the use of a PM to stimulate Compton backscatter (CBS) by retro-reflecting a spent pulse from the Texas Petawatt (TPW) laser after it has driven a cm-scale, GeV LPA. A comparative analysis between the electron and CBS pointing and divergence reveals strong agreement, from shot-to-shot, suggesting a reliable, non-invasive extension for GeV-beam metrology. Our observations confirm the self-aligning PM method is scalable to GeV LPAs, while also suggesting a technique with unique advantages and a robustness that can potentially be exploited for investigations of nonlinear Compton backscatter from ultralow divergence, GeV electrons using the Texas Petawatt Laser.},

abstract = {Finding the exact equation of motion for a moving charged particle is one of the oldest open problems in physics. The problem originates in the emission of radiation by an accelerated charge, which must result with a loss of energy and recoil of the charge, adding a correction to the well-known Lorentz force. When radiation reaction is neglected, it is well known that the dynamics of a charge in a plane-wave laser field are inevitably periodic. Here we investigate the long-time dynamics of a charge in a plane wave and show that all current models of radiation reaction strictly forbid periodic dynamics. Consequently, we find that the loss of energy due to radiation reaction actually causes particles to asymptotically accelerate to infinite kinetic energy. Such a phenomenon persists even in weak laser fields and puts forward the possibility of testing the open problem of radiation reaction through long-duration weak-field precision measurements, rather than through strong-field experiments. Our findings suggest realistic conditions for such measurements through the asymptotic frequency shift and energy loss of a charge, which for example can be detected in electron energy loss spectrometers in electron microscopes.},

abstract = {When accelerated by a constant force in the lab frame, a classical charge experiences no self force. In this case, the particle radiates without dissipating its kinetic and potential energy. But what happens when the particle enters another region with equal and opposite acceleration? Does the oscillating charge lose its mechanical energy similar to a radiating dipole, even though it seems to lose no mechanical energy within each region of constant accel-eration? In this paper, I will show how mechanical energy is transferred to radiation energy via the Schott energy when the particle crosses the boundary between the two regions. In particular, I will show how preacceleration, which is usually regarded as an unphysical effect of the Lorentz-Abraham-Dirac self force, is essential for the energy transfer. Moreover, I will show that the commonly adopted Landau-Lifshitz approximation, which removes preacceleration, introduces second-order secular energy error. On a more fundamental level, the validity of classical electrodynamics is in fact questionable because quantum effects are likely important. The classical prediction can be tested experimentally by observing frequency chirping of radiation, whereby micro physics leaves signatures on macroscopic scales. The required experimental accuracy is estimated. Trap experiment of this type is complementary to collider experiments that endeavor to observe radiation reaction for elementary particles.},

The ability to shape the beam longitudinal phase-space, in particular, plays a key role to achieve high-peak brightness. Here we present a new approach that allows to tune the longitudinal phase-space of a high-brightness beam by means of a plasma wakefields. The electron beam passing through the plasma drives large wakefields that are used to manipulate the time-energy correlation of particles along the beam itself. We experimentally demonstrate that such solution is highly tunable by simply adjusting the density of the plasma and can be used to imprint or remove any correlation onto the beam. This is a fundamental requirement when dealing with largely time-energy correlated beams coming from future plasma accelerators.},

abstract = {A free relativistic electron in an electromagnetic field is a pure case of a light-matter interaction. In the laboratory environment, this interaction can be realized by colliding laser pulses with electron beams produced from particle accelerators. The process of single photon absorption and reemission by the electron, so-called linear Thomson scattering, results in radiation that is Doppler shifted into the x-ray and-ray regions. At elevated laser intensity, nonlinear effects should come into play when the transverse motion of the electrons induced by the laser beam is relativistic. In the present experiment, we achieved this condition and characterized the second harmonic of Thomson x-ray scattering using the counter-propagation of a 60 MeV electron beam and a subterawatt CO 2 laser beam. The process of a linear Thomson scattering predominates at relatively moderate laser intensities. Such scattering generates near-monochromatic and well-collimated radiation that is Doppler-shifted into the x-and-ray regions. A series of proof-of-principle experiments [1-4] brought Thomson scattering x-ray sources to the verge of opening up new fields of application. Such potential applications include medical and biological imaging, picosec-ond and femtosecond x-ray microscopy and holography, dynamic analysis of chemical reactions, phase transitions, and other ultrafast processes traced to atomic precision [5-7]. In nuclear-and high-energy physics, an identical mechanism named Compton scattering can be utilized for prospective positron injectors [8], and-or-lepton colliders [9,10]. Note that the process is called Thomson scattering if the energy of the produced photon is much less than the electron energy, i.e., h m e c 2 , where is the Lorentz factor, e is the electron charge, and m e is the electron mass. Otherwise, it is called Compton scattering. The spectrum and angular pattern of the scattered radiation become more complex when the laser intensity reaches a level where there is an appreciable probability of simultaneous multiphoton absorption by free electrons and the emission of single photons of higher energy. In classical language, nonlinear effects come into play when the transverse motion of the electrons induced by the laser beam is relativistic. The onset of a nonlinear regime usually is characterized by the laser strength parameter a 0  eE=m e ! L c approaching or exceeding unity, where E is the amplitude of laser's electric field, ! L is the laser frequency, and c is the light phase velocity. Nonlinear Thomson scattering has been studied theoretically since the 1960s in the frameworks of classical [11-16], semi-classical [17,18], and quantum theories [19-21]. The theoretical works give us a comprehensive understanding of the spectral-and angular-intensity distributions of Thomson harmonics for arbitrary laser intensity, polarization, and interaction angles [14]. In previous nonlinear Thomson scattering experiments, the second-harmonic radiation first was observed during the interaction of a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser (a 0  0:01) with 1 keV electrons [22], and later it was studied while interacting a mode-locked Nd:YAG laser (a 0  2) with plasma electrons [23]. Researchers at the Stanford Linear Accelerator observed a nonlinear energy shift in the spectrum of electrons scattered off a high-energy (50 GeV) electron beam (e-beam) using a terawatt Nd:glass laser with (a 0  0:6) [24]. However, the detection of the scattered radiation has not been attempted. Thus, until now, theoretical predictions regarding nonlinear Thomson scat-PRL 96, 054802 (2006) P H Y S I C A L},

It enables structures that move at speeds close to the speed of light, such as laser driven wakes, to be visualized. Here we study the process of shadowgraphic image formation during the propagation of a few cycle probe pulse transversely through a laser-driven wake using three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. In order to construct synthetic shadowgrams a near-field snapshot of the ultrashort probe pulse is analyzed by means of Fourier optics, taking into account the effect of a typical imaging setup. By comparing synthetic and experimental shadowgrams we show that the generation of synthetic data is crucial for the correct interpretation of experiments. Moreover, we study the dependence of synthetic shadowgrams on various parameters such as the imaging system aperture, the position of the object plane and the probe pulse delay, duration and wavelength. Finally, we show that time-dependent information from the interaction can be recovered from a single shot by using a broadband, chirped probe pulse and subsequent spectral filtering.},

The calibration was conducted at different bremsstrahlung end point energies - 10.5, 13, 15, and 18 MeV. Experimental spectra show a systematic increase in the maximum energy, photon temperature, and flux. The spectrometer is effective for an energy range of 4-20 MeV with 20{\%}-30{\%} energy resolution. The spectrometer operates in low vacuum with pressure less than 0.1 mbar. Experimental tests showed that operating such a spectrometer in air causes a spuriously enhanced high energy signal due to Compton scattering of photons within air. The article also describes the design and shielding considerations which helped to achieve a dynamic range greater than 30 with this spectrometer. The comparison between the experimental results and Monte Carlo simulations are also presented.},

The degrees of circular and linear polarizations depend both on the density ratio of pair beam to background plasma and initial magnetization, and a maximum degree of circular polarization Pcirc ≈ 18{\%} is found to occur for a tenuous pair beam. We demonstrate that the generation of circularly polarized radiation is intrinsically linked to asymmetric energy dissipation of the pair beam during the filamentation instability dynamics in the electron-ion plasma. These results can help in understanding the recent observations of circularly polarized radiation from gamma-ray-bursts.},

abstract = {Strong-field quantum electrodynamics predicts electron-seeded electron-positron pair cascades when the electric field in the rest-frame of the seed electron approaches the Sauter-Schwinger field, i.e. $\eta$ = E RF /E S ∼ 1. Electrons in the focus of next generation multi-PW lasers are expected to reach this threshold. We identify three distinct cascading regimes in the interaction of counter-propagating, circularly-polarised laser pulses with a thin foil by performing a comprehensive scan over the laser intensity (from 10 23-5 × 10 24 Wcm −2) and initial foil target density (from 10 26-10 31 m −3). For low densities and intensities the number of pairs grows exponentially. If the intensity and target density are high enough the number density of created pairs reaches the relativistically-corrected critical density, the pair plasma efficiently absorbs the laser energy (through radiation reaction) and the cascade saturates. If the initial density is too high, such that the initial target is overdense, the cascade is suppressed by the skin effect. We derive a semi-analytical model which predicts that dense pair plasmas are endemic features of these interactions for intensities above 10 24 Wcm −2 provided the target's relativistic skin-depth is longer than the laser wavelength. Further, it shows that pair production is maximised in near-critical-density targets, providing a guide for near-term experiments.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully.

However, there is far more going on here than what this simple picture might suggest. But first, a brief look at what the classical properties are of angular momentum is needed. 6.1 Classical Spin Angular Momentum A particle moving through space possesses angular momentum, a vector, defined by L = r × p (6.1) where r and p are the position vector and momentum respectively of the particle. This is some-times referred to as orbital angular momentum since, in particular, it is an important consideration in describing the properties of a particle orbiting around some centre of attraction such as, in the classical picture of an atom, electrons orbiting around an atomic nucleus. Classically there is no restriction on the magnitude or direction of orbital angular momentum. From a classical perspective, as an electron carries a charge, its orbital motion will result in a tiny current loop which will produce a dipolar magnetic field. The strength of this dipole field is measured by the magnetic moment µ µ µ which is related to the orbital angular momentum by},

abstract = {To achieve multi-GeV electron energies in the laser wakefield accelerator (LWFA), it is necessary to propagate an intense laser pulse long distances in a plasma without-disruption. One of the purposes of this paper is to evaluate the stability properties of intense laser pulses;propagating extended distances (many tens of Rayleigh ranges) in plasma channels. A three-dimensional envelope equation for the laser field is derived that includes nonparaxial effects such as group velocity dispersion, as well as wakefield and relativistic nonlinearities. It is shown that in the broad beam, short pulse limit the nonlinear terms in the wave equation that lead to Raman and modulation instabilities cancel. This cancellation can result in pulse propagation over extended distances, limited only by dispersion. Since relativistic focusing is not effective for short pulses, the plasma channel provides the guiding necessary fbr long distance propagation Long pulses (greater than several plasma wavelengths), on the other hand, experience substantial modification due to Raman and modulation instabilities. For both short and long pulses the seed for instability growth is inherently determined by the pulse shape and not by background noise. These results would indicate that the self-modulated LWFA is not the optimal configuration for achieving high energies. The standard LWFA, although having smaller accelerating fields, can provide acceleration for longer distances. It is shown that by increasing the plasma density as a function of distance, the phase velocity of the accelerating field behind the laser pulse can be made equal to the speed of light. Thus electron dephasing in the accelerating wakefield can be avoided and energy gain increased by spatially tapering the plasma channel. Depending on the tapering gradient, this luminous wakefield phase velocity is obtained several plasma wavelengths behind the laser pulse. Simulations of laser pulses propagating in a tapered plasma channel are presented. Experimental techniques for generating a tapered density in a capillary discharge are described and an example of a GeV channel guided standard LWFA is presented.},

abstract = {A compact laser synchrotron source (LSS) is proposed as a means of generating tunable, narrow bandwidth, ultra‐short pulses of hard x rays. The LSS is based on the Thomson backscattering of intense laser radiation from a counterstreaming electron beam. Advances in both compact ultra‐intense solid‐state lasers and high brightness electron accelerators make the LSS an attractive compact source of high brightness pulsed x rays, particularly at photon energies beyond ∼30 keV. The x‐ray wavelength is $\lambda$[{\AA}]=650 $\lambda$0[$\mu$m]/Eb2[MeV], where $\lambda$0 is the laser wavelength and Eb is the electron beam energy. For Eb=72 MeV and $\lambda$0=1 $\mu$m, x rays at $\lambda$=0.12 {\AA} (100 keV) are generated. The spectral flux, brightness, bandwidth, and pulse structure are analyzed. In the absence of filtering, the spectral bandwidth in the LSS is typically ≲1{\%} and is limited by electron beam emittance and energy spread. Two configurations of the LSS are discussed, one providing high peak power and the other moderate average power x rays. Using present day technology, the LSS can generate picosecond pulses of x rays consisting of ≳109 photons/pulse with a peak brightness of ≳1020 photons/s mm2 mrad2 (0.1{\%} BW) and photon energies ranging from 50 to 1200 keV.},

For sufficiently intense optical beams the neutral gas undergoes ionization, generating a plasma which tends to defocus the beam. An envelope equation governing the spot size for both types of beams is derived, analyzed, and solved numerically. Self-guided solutions, which result from a balancing of diffraction, plasma defocusing, and nonlinear self-focusing, are analyzed for both types of beams. These equilibrium solutions are found to be unstable due to an ionization-modulation instability for which asymptotic growth rates are obtained. A self-guided inverse Cherenkov accelerator based on the higher-order radially polarized mode is proposed and analyzed. In addition, the depletion of the optical field due to collision and ionization losses is analyzed and the attenuation length is derived.},

There has been a shift in thinking less in terms of PPD per se to poor psychosocial outcomes and difficulties transitioning to the parenting role after giving birth. The objective of this study was to develop a screening tool that identifies women at risk of distress in the postpartum period using information collected prenatally.We used data collected for the All Our Babies Study, a prospective cohort study of pregnant women living in Alberta, Canada (N = 1578) that collects a diverse array of information at three time points during the perinatal period. We developed the tool using 2/3 of the sample and performed internal validation on the remaining 1/3. Using a regression coefficient- based scoring method, we developed an integer score-based prediction rule for the prevalence of PPD at 4 months postpartum.We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios for positive and negative predictive values, and area under the ROC curve by varying the threshold of our screening score for optimal discrimination. The best fit model included known risk factors for PPD and suboptimal psychosocial health: depression and stress in late pregnancy, history of abuse, and poor relationship quality with partner. The area under the ROC curve was 0.76, with acceptable sensitivity and specificity for a cut-off score of 2 (range 0 - 7). Comparison of the tool with a widely used PPD screening inventory showed that our tool had better performance indicators. Further validation of our tool for psychosocial distress was seen in its utility for identifying symptoms of anxiety, in addition to depression, at 4 months.},

We use numerical simulations to demonstrate that a source of collimated multi-MeV photons with conversion efficiency comparable to the one expected for these facilities is achievable at an order of magnitude lower in intensity, within reach of the existing facilities. In the optimal setup, the laser pulse irradiates a bulk solid-density target, heating the target electrons and inducing relativistic transparency. As the pulse then propagates, it generates a beam of energetic electrons which in turn drives a strong azimuthal magnetic field. This field significantly enhances the radiation reaction for the electrons, yielding tens of TW of directed MeV photons for a PW-class laser.},

Stable electron beams from the first stage were used to longitudinally probe the darkcurrent-free, quasi-linear wakefield excited by the laser of the second stage. Changing the arrival time of the electron beam with respect to the second stage laser pulse allowed reconstruction of the temporal wakefield structure, determination of the plasma density, and inference of the length of the electron beam. The first stage electron beam could be focused by an active plasma lens [2] to a spotsize smaller than the transverse wake size at the entrance of the second stage. This permitted electron beam trapping, verified by an 100 MeV energy gain [3].},

abstract = {Wavefront sensing is a set of techniques providing efficient means to ascertain the shape of an optical wavefront or its deviation from an ideal reference. Owing to its wide dynamical range and high optical efficiency, the Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor is nowadays the most widely used of these sensors. Here we show that it actually performs a simultaneous measurement of position and angular spectrum of the incident radiation and, therefore, when combined with tomographic techniques previously developed for quantum information processing, the Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor can be instrumental in reconstructing the complete coherence properties of the signal. We confirm these predictions with an experimental characterization of partially coherent vortex beams, a case that cannot be treated with the standard tools. This seems to indicate that classical methods employed hitherto do not fully exploit the potential of the registered data.},

Optimization of x-ray production from an argon cluster jet, using a genetic algorithm, approximately doubled the measured energy through temporal modification of the 150 mJ driving laser pulse. This approach achieved an increased radiation yield through exploration of a multi-dimensional parameter space, without requiring detailed a priori knowledge of the complex cluster dynamics. The optimized laser pulses exhibited a slow rising edge to the intensity profile, which enhanced the laser energy coupling into the cluster medium, compared to the optimally compressed FWHM pulse (40 fs). Our work suggests that this technique can be more widely utilized for control of intense pulsed secondary radiation from petawatt-class laser systems.},

The ability to predict the spatial, spectral and temporal characteristics of a Compton gamma-ray beam is crucial for the optimization of the operation of a Compton light source as well as for the applications utilizing the Compton beam. In this paper, we present two approaches, one based upon analytical calculations and the other based upon Monte Carlo simulations, to study the Compton scattering process for various electron and laser beam parameters as well as different gamma-beam collimation conditions.

abstract = {The self‐focusing of relativistically intense laser light pulses is analyzed, where the pulse length is short enough that ion inertia prevents any significant motion of ions. Self‐focusing occurs as a result of an increase of the wave refractive index arising from two effects: the mass increase of electrons caused by their relativistic quiver velocity in the light wave, and the reduction of the electron density as a result of ponderomotive force expulsion of the electrons. The latter effect is significant even for rather small values of (P−P L )/P L , where P is the laser beam power and P L is the critical power above which self‐focusing occurs. In fact, for (P−P L )/P L ≳0.1 the effect is so strong that a l l electrons are expelled within a core radial region of the self‐focused laser light channel (this new phenomenon is called e l e c t r o n c a v i t a t i o n).},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although statins have been shown to reduce cardiovascular disease mortality, less than half of U.S. adults achieve their low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goal. In many patients initiated on a statin, adherence rates decrease over time.

OBJECTIVE: To characterize current and former statin users, identify reasons for the discontinuation or switching of statins, and identify factors associated with adherence.

METHODS: The USAGE survey is a cross-sectional, self-administered Internet-based survey of 10,138 U.S. adults fielded September to October 2011. The following statin users were identified and compared: adherent nonswitchers, adherent switchers, non-adherent switchers, and discontinuers. Univariate and multivariate models using a priori covariates for adherence and discontinuation were examined.

RESULTS: Most participants were current statin users who adhered with their prescribed statin (82.5{\%}, n = 8371). Former statin users or discontinuers (12{\%}, n = 1220) cited muscle pain, a side effect, as the primary reason for discontinuation (60{\%}), followed by cost (16{\%}), and then perceived lack of efficacy (13{\%}). Discontinuers were less satisfied with their physicians' explanation of cholesterol treatment, more likely to use the Internet to research statins, and less likely to undergo frequent cholesterol monitoring. Among adherent statin users, the primary reasons for switching were muscle side effects (33{\%}) and cost (32{\%}). Individuals at risk for non-adherence included those with low household income, those who experienced muscle pain as a side effect while on statin therapy, and those taking medication for cardiovascular disease.

CONCLUSION: Statin-related muscle side effects are common and contribute significantly to rates of discontinuation, switching, and non-adherence. Improved physician patient communication about side effects and benefits of statins are necessary to improve both adherence and outcomes.},

In particular, using the modest electron energies obtained with existing laser systems, Compton scattering a photon beam off a relativistic electron bunch has been proposed as a source of high-energy and high-brightness photons. However, laser-plasma based approaches to Compton scattering have not, to date, produced X-rays above 1 keV. Here, we present a simple and compact scheme for a Compton source based on the combination of a laser-plasma accelerator and a plasma mirror. This approach is used to produce a broadband spectrum of X-rays extending up to hundreds of keV and with a 10,000-fold increase in brightness over Compton X-ray sources based on conventional accelerators. We anticipate that this technique will lead to compact, high-repetition-rate sources of ultrafast (femtosecond), tunable (X- through gamma-ray) and low-divergence ({\~{}}1 degree) photons from source sizes on the order of a micrometre.},

abstract = {We develop a classical theory of nonlinear inverse Thomson scattering of a two-wavelength laser beam, which is valid for laser beams with linear or circular polarization and arbitrary intensity and wavelength. We reveal that an electron inside a circularly polarized two-wavelength laser field undergoes a cycloid motion in the transverse plane and radiates an electromagnetic wave forming a spiral phase structure. Its photon energy is proportional to a linear combination of the product between the initial laser photon energies ¯ h$\omega$ 01 and ¯ h$\omega$ 02 , and their harmonic numbers n 1 and n 2 , namely, n 1 ¯ h$\omega$ 01 + n 2 ¯ h$\omega$ 02. The orbital angular momentum of a photon due to the spiral phase structure is given by (n 1 + n 2 ± 1) ¯ h. We show that a combination of two wavelengths differing by one order of magnitude or more is advantageous for producing gamma rays carrying a large orbital angular momentum of ∼10 ¯ h. Moreover, this work indicates that a helical undulator with two magnetic periods is capable of producing photons with a large orbital angular momentum. This radiation process plays an important role in the development of optical vortex beams and even in astrophysical environments.},

To study the effect of the coherency of the photon on Compton scattering, these two formulas were compared for the case of two-photon scattering. The difference might be due to the fact that the Feynman formula cannot take into account the coherency of the photon.

A high energy electron spectrometer has been designed and tested using imaging plate (IP). The measurable energy range extends from 1 to 100 MeV or even higher. The IP response in this energy range is calibrated using electrons from L-band and S-band LINAC accelerator at energies 11.5, 30, and 100 MeV. The calibration has been extended to 0.2 MeV using an existing data and Monte Carlo simulation Electron Gamma Shower code. The calibration results cover the energy from 0.2 to 100 MeV and show almost a constant sensitivity for electrons over 1 MeV energy. The temperature fading of the IP shows a 40{\%} reduction after 80 min of the data taken at 22.5 ° C. Since the fading is not significant after this time we set the waiting time to be 80 min. The oblique incidence effect has been studied to show that there is a 1 / cos ␪ relation when the incidence angle is ␪.},

Normally, when Thomson scattering occurs at high field strengths, there is ponderomotive line broadening in the scattered radiation. This effect makes the bandwidth too large for some applications and reduces the spectral brilliance. We show that such broadening can be corrected and eliminated by suitable frequency modulation of the incident laser pulse. Furthermore, we suggest a practical realization of this compensation idea in terms of a chirped-beam-driven free electron laser oscillator configuration and show that significant compensation can occur, even with the imperfect matching to be expected in these conditions.},

Yet, because of a long injection length, this injection technique leads generally to the production of large energy spread electron beams. Here, we propose to use a shock front transition to localize the injection. Experimental results show that the energy spread can be reduced down to 10 MeV and that the beam energy can be tuned by varying the position of the shock. This simple technique leads to very stable and reliable injection even for modest laser energy. It should therefore become a unique tool for the development of laser-plasma accelerators.},

It could make free electron lasers available to a broad scientific community, and push further the limits of electron accelerators for high energy physics. Furthermore the unique femtosecond nature of the source makes it a promising tool for the study of ultra-fast phenomena. However, applications are hindered by the lack of suitable lens to transport this kind of high-current electron beams, mainly due to their divergence. Here we show that this issue can be solved by using a laser-plasma lens, in which the field gradients are five order of magnitude larger than in conventional optics. We demonstrate a reduction of the divergence by nearly a factor of three, which should allow for an efficient coupling of the beam with a conventional beam transport line.},

abstract = {Accelerating particles to relativistic energies over very short distances using lasers has been a long standing goal in physics. Among the various schemes proposed for electrons, vacuum laser acceleration has attracted considerable interest and has been extensively studied theoretically because of its appealing simplicity: electrons interact with an intense laser field in vacuum and can be continuously accelerated, provided they remain at a given phase of the field until they escape the laser beam. But demonstrating this effect experimentally has proved extremely challenging, as it imposes stringent requirements on the conditions of injection of electrons in the laser field. Here, we solve this long-standing experimental problem for the first time by using a plasma mirror to inject electrons in an ultraintense laser field, and obtain clear evidence of vacuum laser acceleration. With the advent of PetaWatt class lasers, this scheme could provide a competitive source of very high charge (nC) and ultrashort relativistic electron beams.},

Direct numerical integration of the Lienard-Wiechert potentials, in the far field, for extremely high photon energies and many particles is made computationally feasible by a mixed analytic and numerical method. Exact integrals of spectral intensity are made between discretely sampled trajectories, by assuming the space-time four-vector is a quadratic function of proper time. The integral Fourier transform of the trajectory with respect to time, the modulus squared of which comprises the spectral intensity, can then be formed by piecewise summation of exact integrals between discrete points. Because of this, the calculation is not restricted by discrete sampling bandwidth theory and, hence, for smooth trajectories, time steps many orders larger than the inverse of the frequency of interest can be taken.},

Angularly resolved power spectra for electron bunches accelerated in the combined electromagnetic fields due to a Gaussian laser field and a paraboloid potential due to an electron cavity are calculated using a semianalytic numerical algorithm to explicitly calculate the well known spectral integrals. The laser polarizes the resulting x-ray radiation.

We present numerical calculations of the angularly resolved radiation spectrum from an electron bunch with parameters similar to those produced in laser-wakefield-acceleration experiments, interacting with an intense, ultrashort laser pulse. For our parameters, the effect of radiation damping on the angular distribution and energy distribution of photons is not easily discernible for a realistic moderate-emittance electron beam. However, experiments using such a counterpropagating beam–laser geometry should be able to measure these effects using current laser systems through measurement of the electron-beam properties.

abstract = {We present an in-depth experimental-computational study of the parameters necessary to optimize a tunable, quasi-monoenergetic, efficient, low-background Compton backscattering (CBS) x-ray source that is based on the self-aligned combination of a laser-plasma accelerator (LPA) and a plasma mirror (PM). The main findings are (1) an LPA driven in the blowout regime by 30 TW, 30 fs laser pulses produce not only a high-quality, tunable, quasi-monoenergetic electron beam, but also a high-quality, relativistically intense (a 0 ∼ 1) spent drive pulse that remains stable in profile and intensity over the LPA tuning range. (2) A thin plastic film near the gas jet exit retro-reflects the spent drive pulse efficiently into oncoming electrons to produce CBS x-rays without detectable bremsstrahlung background. Meanwhile, anomalous far-field divergence of the retro-reflected light demonstrates relativistic “denting” of the PM. Exploiting these optimized LPA and PM conditions, we demonstrate quasi-monoenergetic (50{\%} FWHM energy spread), tunable (75–200 KeV) CBS x-rays, characteristics previously achieved only on more powerful laser systems by CBS of a split-off, counter-propagating pulse. Moreover, laser-to-x-ray photon conversion efficiency (∼6 × 10−12) exceeds that of any previous LPA-based quasi-monoenergetic Compton source. Particle-in-cell simulations agree well with the measurements.},

Using a jet-blade assembly, experiments sys-tematically varied the shock injector profile, including shock angle, shock position, up-ramp width, and acceleration length. Our work demonstrates that beam energy, energy spread, and pointing can be controlled by adjusting these parameters. As a result, an electron beam that was highly tunable from 25 to 300 MeV with 8{\%} energy spread (DE FWHM /E), 1.5 mrad divergence, and 0.35 mrad point-ing fluctuation was produced. Particle-in-cell simulation characterized how variation in the shock angle and up-ramp width impacted the injection process. This highly controllable LPA represents a suitable, compact electron beam source for LPA applications such as Thomson sources and free-electron lasers. Published by AIP Publishing. https://},

abstract = {Self-guiding of an ultraintense laser requires the refractive index to build up rapidly to a sufficient value before the main body of the pulse passes by. We show that placing a low-intensity precursor in front of the main pulse mitigates the diffraction of its leading edge and facilitates reaching a self-guided state that remains stable for more than 10 Rayleigh lengths. Furthermore, this precursor slows the phase slippage between the trapped electrons and the wakefield and leads to an accelerating structure that is more stable, contains more energy, and is sustained longer. Examples from three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations show that the conversion efficiency from the laser to the self-trapped electrons increases by an order of magnitude when using the precursor.},

abstract = {Experimental results are reported on the temporal and spectral characterization of coherent terahertz (THz) radiation. The radiation is emitted by relativistic electron bunches, which in turn are produced by a laser-driven plasma-based accelerator. As the femtosecond electron bunches exit the plasma-vacuum interface, coherent transition radiation (at THz frequencies) is emitted. Measuring the properties of this radiation allows characterization of the electron bunches. Theoretical work on the emission mechanism is presented, including a model that calculates the THz waveform from a given bunch profile. It is found that the spectrum of the THz pulse is coherent up to the 200-mu m-thick ZnTe detection limit of 4 THz, which corresponds to the production of sub-50 fs (root-mean-square) electron bunch structure. The measurements demonstrate both the shot-to-shot stability of bunch parameters that are critical to THz emission (such as total charge and bunch length), as well as femtosecond synchronization between bunch, THz pulse, and laser beam.},

While classical radiation reaction is a continuous process, in QED, radiation emission is stochastic. The two pictures reconcile in the limit when the emitted photons energy is small compared to the energy of the emitting electrons. The energy spread of the electron distribution function always tends to decrease with classical radiation reaction, whereas the stochastic QED emission can also enlarge it. These two tendencies compete in the QED-dominated regime. Our analysis, supported by the QED module, reveals an upper limit to the maximal attainable energy spread due to stochasticity that depends on laser intensity and the electron beam average energy. Beyond this limit, the energy spread decreases. These findings are verified for different laser pulse lengths ranging from short {\~{}} 30 fs pulses presently available to the long {\~{}} 150 fs pulses expected in the near-future laser facilities, and compared with a theoretical model. Our results also show that near future experiments will be able to probe this transition and to demonstrate the competition between enhanced QED induced energy spread and energy spectrum narrowing from classical radiation reaction.},

abstract = {Scattering relativistic electrons with optical lasers can result in a significant frequency upshift for the photons, potentially producing {\$}\backslashgamma{\$}-rays. This is what linear Compton scattering taught us. Ultra-intense lasers offer nowadays a new paradigm where multi-photon absorption effects come into play. These effects can result in higher harmonics, higher yields and also electron-positron pairs. This article intends to discriminate the different laser scenarios that have been proposed over the past years as well as to give scaling laws for future experiments. The energy conversion from laser or particles to high-frequency photons is addressed for both the well-known counter propagating electron beam-laser interaction and for Quantum-electrodynamics cascades triggered by various lasers. Constructing bright and energetic gamma-ray sources in controlled conditions is within an ace of seeing the light of day.},

abstract = {Under the presence of ultra high intensity lasers or other intense electromagnetic fields the motion of particles in the ultrarelativistic regime can be severely affected by radiation reaction. The standard particle-in-cell (PIC) algorithms do not include radiation reaction effects. Even though this is a well known mechanism, there is not yet a definite algorithm nor a standard technique to include radiation reaction in PIC codes. We have compared several models for the calculation of the radiation reaction force, with the goal of implementing an algorithm for classical radiation reaction in the Osiris framework, a state-of-the-art PIC code. The results of the different models are compared with standard analytical results, and the relevance/advantages of each model are discussed. Numerical issues relevant to PIC codes such as resolution requirements, application of radiation reaction to macro particles and computational cost are also addressed. For parameters of interest where the classical description of the electron motion is applicable, all the models considered are shown to give comparable results. The Landau and Lifshitz reduced model is chosen for implementation as one of the candidates with the minimal overhead and no additional memory requirements.},

We analyse different polarisation orientations and propose a configuration that maximises the cascade multiplicity and favours the laser absorption. We generalise the analytical estimate for the cascade growth rate previously calculated in the field of two colliding linearly polarised laser pulses and account for multiple laser interaction. The estimate is verified by a comprehensive numerical study of four-laser QED cascades across a range of different laser intensities with QED PIC module of OSIRIS. We show that by using four linearly polarised 30 fs laser pulses, one can convert more than 50 {\%} of the total energy to gamma-rays already at laser intensity {\$}I\backslashsimeq10{\^{}}{\{}24{\}}\backslash \backslashmathrm{\{}W/cm{\^{}}2{\}}{\$}.

abstract = {In QED the photon emission process is probabilistic in contrast to classical radiation theory that significantly modifies radiation reaction in ultrastrong laser fields. This fundamental property of photon emission - stochasticity effect (SEs) - can be probed in the electron-laser beam interaction via electron characteristics as shown previously theoretically, but challenging to observe experimentally. In this work we investigate theoretically SEs for the proton energy spectra during laser-plasma interaction in the quantum radiation-dominated regime, which may facilitate SEs experimental observation. An ultrarelativistic plasma generated and driven by an ultraintense laser pulse, collides head-on with counterpropagating laser pulse, which decelerates the electrons due to radiation reaction, and results in significant compression of the proton energy spectra because of the charge separation force.In the considered regime the SEs are demonstrated in the shift of the mean energy of the protons up to hundreds of MeV. The effect is robust with respect to the laser and target parameters and measurable in soon available strong laser facilities.},

The protons are pre-accelerated in the laser-driven wakefields, and are then further accelerated by the collisionless shock, launched from the rear side of the plasma. The shock has a small transverse size, and it generates a strong space-charge field, which defocuses protons in such a way, that only those protons with the highest energies and low energy spread remains collimated. Theoretical and numerical analysis demonstrates production of high-energy proton beams with few tens of percents energy spread, few degrees divergence and charge of few nC. This scheme indicates the efficient generation of quasi-monoenergetic proton beams with energies up to several hundreds of MeV with PW-class ultrashort lasers.},

This density transition is generated by a detached shock wave induced by a cylinder inserted into a supersonic helium gas flow. In a Mach 1.5 flow, the scale length of the density transition Lgrad can approximately equal to plasma wavelength $\lambda$p at the shock front, and can be further reduced with an increase of the flow Mach number. A density down ramp with Lgrad≥$\lambda$p can reduce the phase velocity of the wakefield and lower the energy threshold for the electrons to be trapped. Moreover, the quality of the accelerated beam may be greatly improved by precisely controlling of Lgrad to be one $\lambda$p. For an even sharper density down ramp with Lgrad≪$\lambda$p, the oscillating electrons in the plasma wave will up shift their phase when crossing the ramp, therefore a fraction of the electrons are injected into the accelerating field. For this injection mechanism, there is no threshold requirement for the pump laser intensity to reach wave breaking, which is a big advantage as compared with other injection mechanisms.},

Scaling these compact accelerators to multi-gigaelectronvolt energy would open the prospect of building X-ray free-electron lasers and linear colliders hundreds of times smaller than conventional facilities, but the 1 GeV barrier has so far proven insurmountable. Here, by applying new petawatt laser technology, we produce electron bunches with a spectrum prominently peaked at 2 GeV with only a few per cent energy spread and unprecedented sub-milliradian divergence. Petawatt pulses inject ambient plasma electrons into the laser-driven accelerator at much lower density than was previously possible, thereby overcoming the principal physical barriers to multi-gigaelectronvolt acceleration: dephasing between laser-driven wake and accelerating electrons and laser pulse erosion.

abstract = {Laser-plasma accelerators of only a centimetre's length have produced nearly monoenergetic electron bunches with energy as high as 1 GeV. Scaling these compact accelerators to multi-gigaelectronvolt energy would open the prospect of building X-ray free-electron lasers and linear colliders hundreds of times smaller than conventional facilities, but the 1 GeV barrier has so far proven insurmountable. Here, by applying new petawatt laser technology, we produce electron bunches with a spectrum prominently peaked at 2 GeV with only a few per cent energy spread and unprecedented sub-milliradian divergence. Petawatt pulses inject ambient plasma electrons into the laser-driven accelerator at much lower density than was previously possible, thereby overcoming the principal physical barriers to multi-gigaelectronvolt acceleration: dephasing between laser-driven wake and accelerating electrons and laser pulse erosion. Simulations indicate that with improvements in the laser-pulse focus quality, acceleration to nearly 10 GeV should be possible with the available pulse energy.},

Electron-positron beams and plasmas are believed to play a major role in the dynamics of extreme astrophysical objects such as supermassive black holes and pulsars. For instance, they are believed to be the main constituents of a large number of astrophysical jets, and they have been proposed to significantly contribute to the emission of gamma-ray bursts and their afterglow. However, despite extensive numerical modelling and indirect astrophysical observations, a detailed experimental characterisation of the dynamics of these objects is still at its infancy. Here, we will report on some of the general features of experiments studying the dynamics of electron-positron beams in a fully laser-driven setup.},

Hard x-ray polarimetry of radiation emitted in collisions of heavy ions, electrons or photons with matter provides detailed information on the collision dynamics as well as of the atomic structure in the presence of extreme field strengths. Moreover, it also opens a route for polarization diagnosis of spin-polarized ion and electron beams which, for example, might be useful in future parity non-conservation studies. Owing to recent progress in the development of highly segmented solid-state detectors, a novel type of polarimeter for the hard x-ray regime has become available. Applied as Compton polarimeters, two-dimensional position-sensitive x-ray detectors now allow for precise and efficient measurements of x-ray linear polarization properties. In this report recent polarimetry studies using such detector systems are reviewed.},

abstract = {In laser-solid interactions, electrons may be generated and subsequently accelerated to energies of the order-of-magnitude of the ponderomotive limit, with the underlying process dominated by direct laser acceleration. Breaking this limit, realized here by a radially-polarized laser pulse incident upon a wire target, can be associated with several novel effects. Three-dimensional Particle-In-Cell simulations show a relativistic intense laser pulse can extract electrons from the wire and inject them into the accelerating field. Anti-dephasing, resulting from collective plasma effects, enhances the accelerated electron energy by two-orders of magnitude compared to the ponderomotive limit. It is demonstrated that ultra-short radially polarized pulses produce super-ponderomotive electrons more efficiently than pulses of the linear and circular polarization varieties. Generation of energetic electrons by laser interaction with matter has witnessed considerable development over the past four decades. In the interaction of a laser pulse with an under-dense plasma (ambient electron density n e ≤ 0.03 n c , where n c is the critical density [1]) GeV-energy electron beams can be obtained via wakefield acceleration [2]. Larger numbers of electrons can be accelerated in denser plasmas (n e {\textgreater} 0.1 n c) where direct laser acceleration is dominant, to energies below the pon-deromotive limit [3-8]. The term ponderomotive limit refers to the maximum energy gain, mc 2 a 2 0 /2, by a free electron during interaction with a plane-wave laser pulse [9, 10]. Here, a 0 = eE 0 /(mc$\omega$) is a dimensionless intensity parameter, in which E 0 is the electric field amplitude and $\omega$ its frequency, while m and −e are the mass and charge, respectively, of the electron, and c is the speed of light in vacuum. The ponderomotive scaling [5-10] is widely quoted within the context of discussions of direct laser acceleration [11, 12] in the interaction of intense laser fields with solid targets (n e {\textgreater} n c). Generation of super-ponderomotive electrons (with energies exceeding the ponderomotive limit by up to a factor of 5) in near-critical plasmas (n e n c) has recently been reported [13-22]. This process is associated with important effects , such as the enhancement of ion acceleration in the near-critical plasmas [23]. Electron energy beyond the ponderomotive limit is achieved by anti-dephasing acceleration (ADA). Electrons reach such energies in near-critical plasmas by self-injection into the acceleration phase of the laser field, aided by stochastic motion [14, 15], transverse electric fields [21, 22], and longitudinal electric [16-18] or magnetic fields [13, 20]. In the absence of anti-dephasing, energies of the electrons generated in laser-solid interactions hover, generally, around the ponderomotive limit [5-8]. Only MeV electrons are generated when linearly-polarized (LP) and circularly-polarized (CP) terawatt laser pulses are used. However, an experiment in which a micro-wire, used as an advanced solid target to generate and transport hot electrons over millimeters [24-26], has recently demonstrated reaching double the ponderomo-tive energy, when LP laser pulses are used [27]. Near-critical plasmas can be generated in the vicinity of solid targets for some applications [16, 18]. Here, ADA is put forward as a new mechanism for electron acceleration directly from a solid target. It promises to deliver significantly higher electron energies, and to simplify experimental implementation. Previous work on applications associated with electron acceleration to ponderomotive energies, from laser-solid interactions, include ion acceleration [28, 29], fast ignition [30], laser hole-boring [31], high-order harmonic generation [32, 33], half-cycle XUV pulse generation [34], bremsstrahlung x-ray generation [35], and generation of terahertz radiation [36]. Progress in these applications, possibly among others, stands to be advanced by availability of the more energetic attosecond picocoulomb electron bunches promised in this work. In this Letter, the novel mechanism of ADA, in the interaction of radially-polarized (RP) laser pulses of ul-trashort duration with solid wires, is conceived and intuitively explained, theoretically and by particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. Our investigations demonstrate at-tosecond picocoulomb electron bunches with energies around one hundred MeV, i.e., two orders-of-magnitude higher than the ponderomotive limit, for the first time. Employing RP pulses, electrons are extracted from a wire target, and accelerated by the laser fields, see Fig. 1 for a schematic. Self-injection with a small dephasing rate is caused by the collective motion of the plasma electrons and the complex laser field variations. Direct laser acceleration by LP pulses leads to the generation of periodic electron bunches [37] and CP pulses generate spiral currents [26]. In these cases, the az-imuthal electron motion [20, 38] makes it difficult to define an acceleration phase. By contrast, the acceleration phase in an RP laser field is determined directly by the regions of negative axial electric fields, with their troughs at phases (2N − 1/2)$\pi$, where N is an integer [39].

X-rays radiated by relativistic electrons driven by well-controlled high-power lasers offer a promising route to a proliferation of this powerful imaging technology. A laser-driven plasma wave accelerates and wiggles electrons, giving rise to a brilliant keV X-ray emission. This so-called betatron radiation is emitted in a collimated beam with excellent spatial coherence and remarkable spectral stability. Here we present a phase-contrast microtomogram of a biological sample using betatron X-rays. Comprehensive source characterization enables the reconstruction of absolute electron densities. Our results suggest that laser-based X-ray technology offers the potential for filling the large performance gap between synchrotron- and current X-ray tube-based sources.},

In the case of highly-relativistic motion, electrons tend to form a thin oscillating layer, which makes it possible to model the interaction and obtain the temporal structure of the reflected radiation. The modelling reveals the possibility and conditions for producing singularly intense and short XUV bursts of radiation, which are interesting for many applications. However, the intensity and duration of the XUV bursts, as well as the high-energy end of the harmonic spectrum, depends on the thickness of the layer and its internal structure which are not assessed by such macroscopic modelling. Here we analyse the microscopic physics of this layer and clarify how its parameters are bound and how this controls outlined properties of XUV bursts.},

abstract = {Betatron radiation from laser wakefield accelerators is an ultrashort pulsed source of hard, synchrotron-like x-ray radiation. It emanates from a centimetre scale plasma accelerator producing GeV level electron beams. In recent years betatron radiation has been developed as a unique source capable of producing high resolution x-ray images in compact geometries. However, until now, the short pulse nature of this radiation has not been exploited. This report details the first experiment to utilise betatron radiation to image a rapidly evolving phenomenon by using it to radiograph a laser driven shock wave in a silicon target. The spatial resolution of the image is comparable to what has been achieved in similar experiments at conventional synchrotron light sources. The intrinsic temporal resolution of betatron radiation is below 100 fs, indicating that significantly faster processes could be probed in future without compromising spatial resolution. Quantitative measurements of the shock velocity and material density were made from the radiographs recorded during shock compression and were consistent with the established shock response of silicon, as determined with traditional velocimetry approaches. This suggests that future compact betatron imaging beamlines could be useful in the imaging and diagnosis of high-energy-density physics experiments.},

By experimentally generating the high-quality LWFA e beams with a good stability and repeatability, we have recently produced tunable quasi-monochromatic ultrahigh brilliance MeV $\gamma$-ray via the self-synchronized all-optical Compton scattering scheme and realized a scheme to enhance betatron radiation by manipulating transverse oscillation of electrons in a deflected wakefield with a tilted shock front. The concurrent generation of high-quality e beams and bright x-rays in a compact LWFA may provide practical applications in ultrafast pump-probe study and x-ray radiology fields.},

abstract = {Electron–photon scattering, or Thomson scattering, is one of the most fundamental mechanisms in electrodynamics, underlying laboratory and astrophysical sources of high-energy X-rays. After a century of studies, it is only recently that sufficiently high electromagnetic field strengths have been available to experimentally study the nonlinear regime of Thomson scattering in the laboratory. Making use of a high-power laser and a laser-driven electron accelerator, we made the first measurements of high-order multiphoton scattering, in which more than 500 near-infrared laser photons were scattered by a single electron into a single X-ray photon. Both the electron motion and the scattered photons were found to depend nonlinearly on field strength. The observed angular distribution of scattered X-rays permits independent measurement of absolute intensity, in situ, during interactions of ultra-intense laser light with free electrons. Furthermore, the experiment's potential to generate attosecond-duration hard X-ray pulses can enable the study of ultrafast nuclear dynamics. T homson scattering (TS) 1 is the elastic scattering of photons by electrons, or the long wavelength limit of Compton scattering. As such, it is a fundamental process in electrodynamics, occurring in many laboratory 2 and astrophysical processes 3 , includ-ing Comptonization of the photon energy spectrum of both the cosmic background radiation and the active galactic nuclei. It can serve as an important diagnostic for measuring high-temperature plasmas in magnetic fusion and high-density plasmas in inertial confinement fusion 4,5 . Moreover, it is also the basis for a class of accelerator-driven high-energy X-ray light sources 6–13},

@article{Yu2019,
abstract = {A novel approach is proposed to demonstrate the two-photon Breit-Wheeler process by using collimated and wide-bandwidth $\gamma$-ray pulses driven by 10-PW lasers. Theoretical calculations suggest that more than 3.2 × 10 8 electron-positron pairs with a divergence angle of 7° can be created per shot, and the signal-to-noise ratio is higher than 10 3. The positron signal, which is roughly 100 times higher than the detection limit, can be measured by using the existing spectrometers. This approach, which could demonstrate the e − e þ pair creation process from two photons, would provide important tests for two-photon physics and other fundamental physical theories. The interaction between two photons, which is theoretically well understood by quantum electrodynamics (QED) theories [1-3], has never been observed directly. Experimental study of photon-photon interaction could provide important tests for fundamental theories in physics [1]. The e − e þ pair creation from two-photon interaction, named the Breit-Wheeler (BW) process ($\gamma$ þ $\gamma$ 0 → e þ þ e −) [4,5], is considered to be the first step toward two-photon physics [1-3], since the cross section of the BW process is several orders of magnitude larger than that of photon-photon scattering [6]. In the past few years, there has been increased interest [6-12] in investigating the two-photon BW process in the laboratory, even though the multiphoton BW process ($\gamma$ þ n$\gamma$ 0 → e þ þ e −) was demonstrated in 1997 [13]. The conventional accelerator-based photon-photon col-lider [6,8,9] is considered to be controllable, reliable, and reproducible, but a large machine is needed [6]. A laser-based photon-photon collider [7,10-12] could produce 10 2-10 5 two-photon BW events in a single shot. Pike et al. [7] proposed the first scheme of a photon-photon collider in vacuum. In that scheme, a large number of background events are generated from the Bethe-Heitler process [14,15] since most of the $\gamma$-ray photons out of the focal spot interact with the hohlraum. Ribeyre and co-workers [10,11] proposed a photon-photon collider to produce e − e þ pairs in a preferential direction by using mega-electron-volt photon sources. However, efforts are needed to distinguish the signal from the much larger number of background positrons generated from the stage of $\gamma$-ray source production [16-18]. The production of the two-photon BW process is a function of photon number, collision area size, and photon-photon cross section [10]. Laser power density above 10 23 W=cm 2 should be accessible in the upcoming laser facilities [19,20]. Under such power density, a large number ({\textgreater}10 13) of $\gamma$ rays ({\textgreater}0.511 MeV) [16,18,21-27] can be generated with a large divergence angle of ∼30° [16,22,25,27,28]. The photon source of such a huge number could be a perfect choice for a photon-photon collider only if the photon divergence and the background positrons can be greatly reduced. In this Letter, a photon-photon collider is proposed by using the wide-bandwidth $\gamma$-ray pulses generated from the interaction between 10-PW lasers and narrow tube targets [24]. In each $\gamma$-ray pulse, ∼10 14 $\gamma$-ray photons are colli-mated into a divergence angle of 3°. Theoretical calculations suggest that more than 3.2 × 10 8 positrons with a divergence angle of 7° can be generated in a single shot. The signal of the collimated positrons is roughly 100 times higher than the detectable threshold of the existing spectrometer [29,30], and the noise level (positrons generated from other processes) is less than 0.1{\%} of the signal. With this proposal, observation of the two-photon interaction predicted by the QED theories would become a reality in the laboratory. In the photon-photon collisions, more events can be generated with higher flux photon beams. The rapid PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS 122, 014802 (2019) 0031-9007=19=122(1)=014802(6) 014802-1},

As two color pulses copropagate in the background plasma, the peak amplitude of the combined laser field is modulated in time and space during the laser propagation due to the plasma dispersion. Ionization injection occurs when the peak amplitude exceeds a certain threshold. The threshold is exceeded for limited duration periodically at different propagation distances, leading to multiple ionization injections and separated electron bunches. The method is demonstrated through multidimensional particle-in-cell simulations. Such electron bunches may be used to generate multichromatic x-ray sources for a variety of applications.},

abstract = {Electron radiation and $\gamma$ photon annihilation are two of the major processes in ultra intense lasers (UIL). Understanding their behavior in one coherence interval (CI) is the basis for UIL-matter interaction researches. However, most existing analytic formulae only give the average over many CIs. Present understanding of these two multi-photon processes in one CI usually assume that they emit forward and their spectra have a cutoff at the energy of the electron/$\gamma$. Such assumptions ignore the effects of involved laser photons (EILP). We deduced the formulae for these two processes in one CI with EILP included and give the conditions for the EILP to be significant. Strong EILP introduces new behaviors into these two processes in one CI, such as large angle emission and emit particles above the usually assumed cutoff. Simulations show that the EILP would be significant when laser intensity reaches 2 × 10 22 W/cm 2 , which is within the reach of state-of-art lasers. Laser is presently the most intense electromagnetic field in laboratory. On next generation 10-100 petawatt laser facilities such as ELI 1 , laser intensity is anticipated to reach 10 23-25 W/cm 2 , which is several orders higher than the present record of 2 × 10 22 W/cm 2 2. Such strong lasers will open a gate for many fundamental and fantastic strong field quantum electrodynamics (SFQED) phenomena 3-7. For recent reviews, see 8-10. At such intensity, laser-matter interaction enters a new regime where two multi-photon SFQED processes, the quantum process of electron radiation (nonlinear Compton scattering, NCS) $\gamma$ $\gamma$ + → ′ + ′ − − e p n k k e p () () () (), (1) l and $\gamma$ photon annihilation into an electron-positron pair (nonlinear Breit-Wheeler process, NBW) $\gamma$ $\gamma$ ″ + ′ → ″ +. − + k n k e p e p () () () () (2) l become significant, i. e., can take a large fraction of laser energy (p, k, etc. are 4 vector momenta). In ultra intense lasers, the CI of NCS and NBW $\delta$$\phi$ ∼  a 1/ 1 0 is very short, where the normalized field amplitude ≡ − = $\mu$ $\mu$ a e a a m eE mk , (3) L 0 0 e and m are electron charge and mass, a $\mu$ , E L and k 0 are the 4-vector, electric field and photon energy of the laser. Short CI means NCS and NBW happen in different CIs are independent from each other. NCS/NBW within a CI is then governed by the local field F $\mu$$\nu$ and instantaneous energy-momentum of the electron/$\gamma$. Secondary interactions and back reactions are usually very strong in UILs, many emitted $\gamma$ photons can produce e − − e + pairs and the produced charges can radiate, etc. NCSs can also change the electron and positron},

abstract = {Compton scattering between a photon and an electron is one of the most basic QED processes. Recent developments of lasers provide unique dense and coherent sources of photon. Electron scattering with strong lasers then becomes nonlinear Compton scattering which involves multiple photons. Present understanding on nonlinear Compton scattering includes several classical ideas such as forward emission, recoil reaction and spectrum cutoff. We investigated multiple photon effects in nonlinear Compton scattering in ultra intense lasers with strong field QED theory. New features of nonlinear Compton scattering induced by multiple photon effects including fixed emission angle, deflection of electron, and disappear of spectrum cutoff are deduced. Results show that nonlinear Compton scattering would be reshaped by involved coherent photons in ultra intense lasers and corresponding signal is measurable on {\$}10{\$}PW scale lasers.},

The optical characteristics of amplified and compressed femtosecond-duration light from a chirped-pulse amplification laser are shown to remain invariant and maintain high-fidelity using this system. When the peak power was varied by an order-of-magnitude, up to its maximum attainable value, the phase, spectral bandwidth, polarization state, and focusability of the light remained constant. This capability led to precise control of the focused laser intensity and enabled a correspondingly high level of control over the power of an all-laser-driven Thomson X-ray light source.},

abstract = {We propose and demonstrate a terahertz (THz) oscilloscope for recording time information of an ultrashort electron beam. By injecting a laser-driven THz pulse with circular polarization into a dielectric tube, the electron beam is swept helically such that the time information is uniformly encoded into the angular distribution that allows one to characterize both the temporal profile and timing jitter of an electron beam. The dynamic range of the measurement in such a configuration is significantly increased compared to deflection with a linearly polarized THz pulse. With this THz oscilloscope, nearly 50-fold longitudinal compression of a relativistic electron beam to about 15 fs (rms) is directly visualized with its arrival time determined with 3 fs accuracy. This technique bridges the gap between streaking of photoelectrons with optical lasers and deflection of relativistic electron beams with radio-frequency deflectors, and should have wide applications in many ultrashort electron-beam-based facilities. The ability to characterize the time information of an ultrashort electron beam including both the temporal profile and arrival time is crucial for optimizing and enhancing the performance of many electron-beam-based scientific facilities such as free-electron lasers (FELs [1-3]), ultrafast electron diffraction (UED [4,5]) and microscopy (UEM [6-9]), laser-driven and beam-driven advanced accelerators [10-15], etc. In the accelerator community, rf deflecting cavities have been widely used to measure the temporal profile of relativistic electron beams with energy ranging from MeV to GeV (see, e.g., Refs. [16-18]). However, the information of beam arrival time with respect to an external laser as required in a pump-probe experiment cannot be directly measured with a rf deflector. In the attosecond science community, streaking of photoelectrons with optical lasers has become a standard technique for characterizing the complete information of attosecond pulses [19]. Recently, this technique has been adapted to characterize femtosecond x-ray pulses in FELs with the streaking imprinted by far-infrared and THz pulses [20-23]. However, this technique does not apply to a relativistic electron beam, as dictated by the Lawson-Woodward theorem [24]. Very recently, THz streaking of keV and MeV electrons [25-27] in a subwave-length metallic structure has been used to measure both the temporal profile and the arrival time of electron beams. However, the small aperture used to enhance the THz field may significantly limit the number of useful electrons. Furthermore, with the streaking imprinted by a linearly polarized THz pulse, the beam receives sinusoidal angular streaking, and thus the measurement has a rather limited dynamic range (time window where the measurement is accurate) comparable to about one-quarter of the wavelength. In this Letter, we demonstrate a laser-driven THz oscilloscope that allows one to record the complete time information of an ultrashort electron beam with both large dynamic range and high temporal resolution. This scheme exploits the sustained interaction between the THz pulse and the electron beam in a dielectric tube, allowing sufficient deflection to be generated without enhancing the THz field with a narrow slit.},

abstract = {It is found that the three-dimensional laser-driven plasma bubble and the electron injection process can be manipulated by incorporating an external magnetic field and a plasma density gradient both along the longitudinal direction. The down-ramp of a density-profile-tailored plasma increases the wavelength of the plasma wake and hence reduces its phase velocity, which helps to trigger the electron injection. While a longitudinal magnetic field induces dynamically an expanding electron density hole in the rear of the wake bubble, which tends to reduce the peak electron velocity there. Electron injection is braked as soon as the electron peak velocity is less than the phase velocity when the density hole is large enough. Consequently, the start and end positions of electron injection can be flexibly controlled, which can lead to sub-femotsecond electron bunches with the peak current of a few kilo-Ampere when a magnetic field at {\$}\backslashsim 10{\$} Tesla level is applied.},

Generation of these beams is associated with injection occurring on the density down ramp between the stages. This well-localized injection produces a bunch of electrons performing coherent betatron oscillations in the wakefield, resulting in a significant increase in the x-ray yield. Annular electron distributions are detected in 40{\%} of shots under optimal conditions. Simultaneous control of the pulse duration and frequency chirp enables optimization of both the energy and the energy spread of the annular beam and boosts the radiant energy per unit charge by almost an order of magnitude.

abstract = {Pair production can be triggered by high-intensity lasers via the Breit-Wheeler process. However, the straightforward laser-laser colliding for copious numbers of pair creation requires light intensities several orders of magnitude higher than possible with the ongoing laser facilities. Despite the numerous proposed approaches, creating high-energy-density pair plasmas in laboratories is still challenging. Here we present an all-optical scheme for overdense pair production by two counter-propagating lasers irradiating near-critical-density plasmas at only ∼10(22) W cm(-2). In this scheme, bright $\gamma$-rays are generated by radiation-trapped electrons oscillating in the laser fields. The dense $\gamma$-photons then collide with the focused counter-propagating lasers to initiate the multi-photon Breit-Wheeler process. Particle-in-cell simulations indicate that one may generate a high-yield (1.05 × 10(11)) overdense (4 × 10(22) cm(-3)) GeV positron beam using 10 PW scale lasers. Such a bright pair source has many practical applications and could be basis for future compact high-luminosity electron-positron colliders.},

In order to obtain full control of the gas particle number density in the interaction region, thus allowing for a long term stable and manageable LWFA, real-time monitoring is necessary. In fact, the ideal gas law cannot be used to estimate the particle density inside the flow cell based on the preset backing pressure and the room temperature because the gas flow depends on several factors like tubing, regulators and valves in the gas supply system, as well as vacuum chamber volume and vacuum pump speed/throughput. Here, second-harmonic interferometry is applied to measure the particle number density inside a flow gas cell designed for LWFA. The results demonstrate that real-time monitoring is achieved, and that using low backing pressure gas ({\textless} 1 bar) and different cell orifice diameters ({\textless} 2 mm) it is possible to finely tune the number density up to the range well suited for LWFA.},

abstract = {Electron-positron pair creation is considered when intense laser pulses collide head-on with {\textless}1 MeV x-ray photons in the presence of stationary Coulomb charges Zð−eÞ. The analysis employs Coulomb-corrected Volkov states and is not limited to Born's approximation in Z. The cross section and the yield increase dramatically with increasing Z, potentially enabling (i) measurable yields with petawatt lasers and (ii) sensitive tests of strong-field QED. Vacuum has characteristics resembling a tangible medium due to the coupling of its virtual particle-anti-particle field with external fields [1,2]. It has complex-valued permittivity and permeability tensors [3-9] and manifests nonlinear properties in uncommonly intense fields [10-15]. Figure 1(a) shows pair creation ex nihilo by collision of two photons $\gamma$ þ $\gamma$ → e − þ e þ in what is referred to as the Breit-Wheeler process [2,16]. With intense lasers the rates for many QED processes enter the realm of observation, e.g., [15-32]. SLAC's pioneering photoproduction $\gamma$ þ n$\omega$ → e − þ e þ experiments ushered in a new era by colliding high-energy photons $\gamma$ with n TW-class laser photons $\omega$ [16,33-35]. For this variant of the Breit-Wheeler process [2], e.g., [36-44] to be allowed the Mandelstam invariant ffiffi ffi s p must exceed 2m, imposing a lower bound on the integer n. The high-energy photons were generated by Compton scattering laser photons from ∼50GeV electrons, enabling the reaction with n {\textgreater} 4. Analysis of QED processes in intense fields is facilitated by known exact solutions of Dirac's equation representing dressed electron-positron states (Volkov states) [2,16]. Positrons can be also produced in the presence of an external charge Zð−eÞ via the Bethe-Heitler process $\gamma$ þ Z → Z þ e − þ e þ , Fig. 1(b)[2,16] and, e.g., [45-51]. Variants of Schwinger, of Breit-Wheeler, of Bethe-Heitler processes, and combinations thereof, have been analyzed, e.g., [27,52-71]. Lorentz boosts when relativistic nuclei are employed enhance the production rate, e.g., [49,53-56,58,68]; the yield has been determined for LHC-class nuclei in the Born approximation, assuming Z$\alpha$ ≪ 1 ($\alpha$ ¼ e 2 =ℏc) [72,73]. The pair production rate depends sensitively on the ratio of the laser electric field E L to the Schwinger electric field E S ¼ m 2 c 3 =ℏjej. When E L =E S is small the process is in the tunneling regime where the rate is exponentially small, scaling as ∼e −E S =E L , e.g., [59,60]. In the opposite limit the exponential factor does not appear, and the rate is far more prolific, e.g., [68]. In order to access the prolific regime of the Breit-Wheeler process using currently available lasers, GeV-class photons are required [33-35]. The process considered here is sketched in Fig. 2(a), where laser photons collide head-on with high-energy ({\textless}2mc 2) photons in the presence of stationary nuclei with high Z-wherein the Born approximation is inapplicable [74]. For this process the assist given by x-ray photons with frequency $\omega$ X to leptons to tunnel through the barrier is conveniently measured by parameters $\kappa$, $\xi$ defined by $\kappa$ ≡ ℏ$\omega$ X =2mc 2 ; $\xi$ ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 1 − ð ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi 8 þ $\kappa$ 2 p − $\kappa$Þ$\kappa$=2 q : ð1Þ The pair production rate is now proportional to ∼C 2 ðZÞe −$\beta$ , where $\beta$ ¼ 4 ffiffi ffi 3 p $\xi$ 3 ðE S =E L Þ=ð1 þ $\xi$ 2 Þ [Eqs. (7) and (8) below]. When $\beta$ ≫ 1 the rate is again exponentially small. However, the factor in the exponential involving $\xi$ rapidly vanishes as ℏ$\omega$ X → 2mc 2 ð$\kappa$ → 1; $\xi$ → 0Þ, thus enhancing the production rate. Additionally, C 2 ðZÞ is a very strong function of Z. This shows that (i) the rate is strongly enhanced by the presence of Coulomb charges, and (ii) the prolific regime can be accessed with ∼1 MeV photons. This Letter explores the regime $\beta$ ≫ 1 leaving the opposite limit for future research. There are numerous analyses of QED in the presence of strong laser fields.

abstract = {Electron-positron pair creation is considered when intense laser pulses collide head-on with {\textless}1 MeV x-ray photons in the presence of stationary Coulomb charges Zð−eÞ. The analysis employs Coulomb-corrected Volkov states and is not limited to Born's approximation in Z. The cross section and the yield increase dramatically with increasing Z, potentially enabling (i) measurable yields with petawatt lasers and (ii) sensitive tests of strong-field QED. Vacuum has characteristics resembling a tangible medium due to the coupling of its virtual particle-anti-particle field with external fields [1,2]. It has complex-valued permittivity and permeability tensors [3-9] and manifests nonlinear properties in uncommonly intense fields [10-15]. Figure 1(a) shows pair creation ex nihilo by collision of two photons $\gamma$ þ $\gamma$ → e − þ e þ in what is referred to as the Breit-Wheeler process [2,16]. With intense lasers the rates for many QED processes enter the realm of observation, e.g., [15-32]. SLAC's pioneering photoproduction $\gamma$ þ n$\omega$ → e − þ e þ experiments ushered in a new era by colliding high-energy photons $\gamma$ with n TW-class laser photons $\omega$ [16,33-35]. For this variant of the Breit-Wheeler process [2], e.g., [36-44] to be allowed the Mandelstam invariant ffiffi ffi s p must exceed 2m, imposing a lower bound on the integer n. The high-energy photons were generated by Compton scattering laser photons from ∼50GeV electrons, enabling the reaction with n {\textgreater} 4. Analysis of QED processes in intense fields is facilitated by known exact solutions of Dirac's equation representing dressed electron-positron states (Volkov states) [2,16]. Positrons can be also produced in the presence of an external charge Zð−eÞ via the Bethe-Heitler process $\gamma$ þ Z → Z þ e − þ e þ , Fig. 1(b)[2,16] and, e.g., [45-51]. Variants of Schwinger, of Breit-Wheeler, of Bethe-Heitler processes, and combinations thereof, have been analyzed, e.g., [27,52-71]. Lorentz boosts when relativistic nuclei are employed enhance the production rate, e.g., [49,53-56,58,68]; the yield has been determined for LHC-class nuclei in the Born approximation, assuming Z$\alpha$ ≪ 1 ($\alpha$ ¼ e 2 =ℏc) [72,73]. The pair production rate depends sensitively on the ratio of the laser electric field E L to the Schwinger electric field E S ¼ m 2 c 3 =ℏjej. When E L =E S is small the process is in the tunneling regime where the rate is exponentially small, scaling as ∼e −E S =E L , e.g., [59,60]. In the opposite limit the exponential factor does not appear, and the rate is far more prolific, e.g., [68]. In order to access the prolific regime of the Breit-Wheeler process using currently available lasers, GeV-class photons are required [33-35]. The process considered here is sketched in Fig. 2(a), where laser photons collide head-on with high-energy ({\textless}2mc 2) photons in the presence of stationary nuclei with high Z-wherein the Born approximation is inapplicable [74]. For this process the assist given by x-ray photons with frequency $\omega$ X to leptons to tunnel through the barrier is conveniently measured by parameters $\kappa$, $\xi$ defined by $\kappa$ ≡ ℏ$\omega$ X =2mc 2 ; $\xi$ ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 1 − ð ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi 8 þ $\kappa$ 2 p − $\kappa$Þ$\kappa$=2 q : ð1Þ The pair production rate is now proportional to ∼C 2 ðZÞe −$\beta$ , where $\beta$ ¼ 4 ffiffi ffi 3 p $\xi$ 3 ðE S =E L Þ=ð1 þ $\xi$ 2 Þ [Eqs. (7) and (8) below]. When $\beta$ ≫ 1 the rate is again exponentially small. However, the factor in the exponential involving $\xi$ rapidly vanishes as ℏ$\omega$ X → 2mc 2 ð$\kappa$ → 1; $\xi$ → 0Þ, thus enhancing the production rate. Additionally, C 2 ðZÞ is a very strong function of Z. This shows that (i) the rate is strongly enhanced by the presence of Coulomb charges, and (ii) the prolific regime can be accessed with ∼1 MeV photons. This Letter explores the regime $\beta$ ≫ 1 leaving the opposite limit for future research. There are numerous analyses of QED in the presence of strong laser fields. The very large increase in the pair production yield with Z to be demonstrated here can be useful for testing FIG. 1. Production of e −-e þ pair, described by plane waves with momenta p − ; −p þ.

Therefore, the framework of self-consistent and fully relativistic particle-in-cell simulations is employed. In particular, the interaction of a solid target irradiated at normal incidence with an ultraintense laser pulse is considered. It is shown that one can form an adequate environment for a 100 GeV class electron beam to reach a completely novel super strong-field sector of quantum electrodynamics. In this regime, the influence of radiative corrections to strong-field processes can no longer be treated perturbatively. Since so far there is no reliable theory describing this strongly coupled regime, the present paper is dedicated to draw attention to this unstudied issue by pointing out a feasible experimental setup.},

abstract = {A novel algorithm developed for supersonic gas jet profile retrieval from interferometric measurement is presented. The algorithm uses the Fourier transform method for the phase map restoration and method based on radial profile approximation by a set of hyper-Gaussian functions and their forward Abel transform for 3D gas density profile restoration. The numerical algorithm of the 3D gas density profile restoration based on expansion of the density radial distribution by a basis of hyper-Gaussian functions is compared with algorithms of the inverse Abel transform. Examining accuracy of the algorithms shows that the developed approach is more stable than the inverse Abel transform, and, in the case of axisymmetric objects like supersonic gas jets, it provides higher accuracy. The developed technique was applied for studying the density profile of the pulsed nitrogen supersonic jet produced using a de'Laval nozzle with an exit diameter of 1.5 mm. It is shown that the radial density distributions at distances of 10-700 $\mu$m behind the nozzle exit have a hyper-Gaussian-like form with sharp boundaries and a jet top of ∼0.8 mm length, where gas density is about 5.5 {\textperiodcentered} 10 18 cm −3 and varies by no more than 10{\%}.},

abstract = {Power amplification and pulse compression of short-pulse laser beams by three-wave nonlinear processes in a plasma was proposed by Malkin, Shvets, and Fisch [Phys. Rev. Lett. 82, 4448 (1999)] as a potential path to exceed the limits of the highly successful technique of chirped pulse amplification [D. Strickland and G. Mourou, Opt. Commun. 56, 219 (1985)] developed three decades ago. The parametric processes considered, Raman and Brillouin scattering, are notoriously difficult to control and to predict theoretically because of the dependence on plasma properties and other nonlinear processes. Previous experiments of backward Raman and Brillouin amplifiers have fallen far short of the predictions of simulations and theory and achieved only a very small energy transfer. In this paper, laser-plasma amplification of subpicosecond pulses above the Joule level is demonstrated with a large energy transfer and a very high efficiency, up to 20{\%}, a major milestone for this scheme to become a solution for the next generation of ultrahigh-intensity lasers. In addition, three-dimensional simulations of the amplification process quantitatively match the experimental results and demonstrate the ability of predictive simulations for the optimization of experiments. The global behavior of the amplification process is reproduced, including the evolution of the spatial profile of the amplified seed, the pulse length of the amplified seed, and the influence of parasitic spontaneous Raman and Brillouin scattering.},

As an example we employ these solutions to calculate the radiation emission of positrons and electrons trapped in the planar potential found between the (110) planes in Silicon. This allows us to compare with the semi-classical method of Baier, Katkov and Strakhovenko, which includes the effect of spin and photon recoil, but neglects the quantization of the transverse motion. For high-energy electrons, the high-energy part of the angularly integrated photon energy spectrum calculated with the found wave functions differs from the corresponding one calculated with the semi-classical method. However, for lower particle energies it is found that the angularly integrated emission energy spectra obtained via the semi-classical method is in fairly good agreement with the full quantum calculation except that the positions of the harmonic peaks in photon energy and the photon emission angles are shifted.},

abstract = {Analytical calculations of radiative corrections in strong-field QED have hinted that in the presence of an intense plane wave the effective coupling of the theory in the high-energy sector may increase as the {\$}(2/3){\$}-power of the energy scale. These findings have raised the question of their compatibility with the corresponding logarithmic increase of radiative corrections in QED in vacuum. However, all these analytical results in strong-field QED have been performed within the limiting case of a background constant crossed field. Starting from the polarization operator and the mass operator in a general plane wave, we show that the constant-crossed-field limit and the high-energy limit do not commute with each other and identify the physical parameter discriminating between the two alternative limits orders. As a result, we find that the power-law asymptotic scaling pertains strictly speaking only to the case of a constant-crossed-field background field, whereas high-energy radiative corrections in a general plane wave depend logarithmically on the energy scale as in vacuum. However, we also confirm the possibility of testing the `power-law' regime experimentally by means of realistic setups involving high-power lasers or high-density electron-positron bunches.},

The latter method includes realistic focusing laser fields, which allows us to simulate a near-term experimentally feasible scenario of a 8 GeV electron beam scattering from a 1 PW laser pulse and provide a measurement that would verify the ultrafast radiative polarization in high-intensity laser pulses that we predict. Aspects of spin dependent radiation reaction are also discussed, with spin polarization leading to a measurable (5{\%}) splitting of the energies of spin-up and spin-down electrons.},

abstract = {In high-intensity ({\textgreater}1021 Wcm -2) laser-matter interactions gamma-ray photon emission by the electrons can strongly affect the electron's dynamics and copious numbers of electron-positron pairs can be produced by the emitted photons. We show how these processes can be included in simulations by coupling a Monte Carlo algorithm describing the emission to a particle-in-cell code. The Monte Carlo algorithm includes quantum corrections to the photon emission, which we show must be included if the pair production rate is to be correctly determined. The accuracy, convergence and energy conservation properties of the Monte Carlo algorithm are analysed in simple test problems. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {In this paper we discuss the dynamics of charged particles in high-intensity laser fields in the context of the Frenet-Serret formalism, which describes the intrinsic geometry of particle world-lines. We find approximate relations for the Frenet-Serret scalars and basis vectors relevant for high-intensity laser particle interactions. The onset of quantum effects relates to the curvature radius of classical trajectories being on the order of the Compton wavelength. The effects of classical radiation reaction are discussed, as well as the classical precession of the spin-polarization vector according to the Thomas-Bargman-Michel-Telegdi (T-BMT) equation. We comment on the derivation of the photon emission rate in strong-field QED beyond the locally constant field approximation, which is used in Monte Carlo simulations of quantum radiation reaction. Such a numerical simulation is presented for a possible experiment to distinguish between classical and quantum mechanical models of radiation reaction.},

abstract = {Plasma wakefield acceleration (PWFA) is a novel acceleration technique with promising prospects for both particle colliders and light sources. However, PWFA research has so far been limited to a few large-scale accelerator facilities world-wide. Here, we present first results on plasma wakefield generation using electron beams accelerated with a 100-TW-class Ti:Sa laser. Due to their ultrashort duration and high charge density, the laser-accelerated electron bunches are suitable to drive plasma waves at electron densities in the order of {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}19{\}}{\$} cm{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}}{\$}. We capture the beam-induced plasma dynamics with femtosecond resolution using few-cycle optical probing and, in addition to the plasma wave itself, we observe a distinctive transverse ion motion in its trail. This previously unobserved phenomenon can be explained by the ponderomotive force of the plasma wave acting on the ions, resulting in a modulation of the plasma density over many picoseconds. Due to the scaling laws of plasma wakefield generation, results obtained at high plasma density using high-current laser-accelerated electron beams can be readily scaled to low-density systems. Laser-driven PWFA experiments can thus act as miniature models for their larger, conventional counterparts. Furthermore, our results pave the way towards a novel generation of laser-driven PWFA, which can potentially provide ultra-low emittance beams within a compact setup.},

If, on the other hand, the electron has been interacting with the electromagnetic wave train a sufficiently long time before the actual observation of a Compton scattering event, an intensity-dependent frequency shift will in fact be present.},
