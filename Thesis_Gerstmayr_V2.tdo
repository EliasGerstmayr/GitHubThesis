\contentsline {todo}{\color@fb@x {}{black}{}{blue!40}{\leavevmode {\color {blue!40}o}}\ EG: Question to ask Stuart: Do I need to talk about source size and potential divergence here to justify overlap or is it enough to say I assume the overlap. Despite its low divergence the collimated gamma beam will be around $6.2\pm 0.1\tmspace +\thinmuskip {.1667em}\mathrm {mm}$ wide at the interaction point, $865\pm 4.5\tmspace +\thinmuskip {.1667em}\mathrm {mm}$ downstream from the converter target. The X-ray source is much closer to the interaction point and will be smaller at around XX MM NUMBER. The spatial overlap of both photon sources is hence guaranteed on each shot. The temporal overlap is also secured as the North beam is a $40\tmspace +\thinmuskip {.1667em}\mathrm {ps}$ long heater and timing fluctuations at Gemini have been measured to be of order of 10's of $\mathrm {fs}$ \cite {Shalloo_GEMINIDRIFT}.}{239}{section*.342}

There might be a angle change if the spool is replaced.}{240}{section*.344}
