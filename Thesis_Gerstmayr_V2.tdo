Despite its low divergence the collimated gamma beam will be around $6.2\pm 0.1\tmspace +\thinmuskip {.1667em}\mathrm {mm}$ wide at the interaction point, $865\pm 4.5\tmspace +\thinmuskip {.1667em}\mathrm {mm}$ downstream from the converter target. The X-ray source is much closer to the interaction point and will be smaller at around XX MM NUMBER. The spatial overlap of both photon sources is hence guaranteed on each shot. The temporal overlap is also secured as the North beam is a $40\tmspace +\thinmuskip {.1667em}\mathrm {ps}$ long heater and timing fluctuations at Gemini have been measured to be of order of 10's of $\mathrm {fs}$ \cite {Shalloo_GEMINIDRIFT}.}{233}{section*.296}
