\@writefile{tdo}{\contentsline {todo}{\color@fb@x {}{black}{}{green!40}{\leavevmode {\color {green!40}o}}\ SM: The positrons produced by the BW process are detected by the timepix3 detectors. These are sensitive to gamma rays and charged particles over a wide range of energies. The shape of the tracks in the detector allows some events to be excluded. For example, low energy charged particles produce wiggly tracks, high energy particles or gammas produce straight tracks, the length of which provides information about the angle of incidence. As positrons transported from the collision point enter the detectors within a specific range of angles, this can be used to exclude some high energy events. Events which are not excluded are “candidate events”. \par Gamma rays can interact with material in the chamber (eg the magnets, the second lead collimator) and produce positrons via the BH process that have similar characteristics (energy, angle into the chicane) so that they are indistinguishable from BW positrons on the detector. Gammas striking the vacuum windows can also scatter into the detector at the angle corresponding to a candidate event. \par We might expect that the number of these noise events will depend on the gamma yield, the following section examines this.... \par }{208}{section*.241}}

I think you mean 130? , as 180 would be head on). For simplicity you ignore angular spread of both photon sources. \par The higher energy gamma rays present on some days can produce pairs with lower energy X-ray photons, however these don’t reach the collision point as they are absorbed in the plastic on which the foil is mounted. \par As a result, the level of fluctuation in pair yield from day to day (and shot to shot) is suppressed. }{221}{section*.269}}
