... LWFA is versatile radiation source (betatron, linear ICS, non-linear ICS, bremsstrahlung)

\EliasComm{Make a plot of gamma radiation spectra to show the bandwidth and spectral shapes.}

... showed application of gamma spectrometer for measuring radiation in the range of few 100's keV to 100's MeV (betatron, linear ICS, nonlinear ICS, bremsstrahlung)

... shown gamma ray signal and background characterisation can be used to identify successful collisions in an ICS setup (linear and nonlinear ICS)

... shown control over laser and electron overlap over course of 100's of shots (linear ICS, nonlinear 4)

... retrieval requires shape input and hence detailed knowledge of the physics (all results)

... showed that smaller variations in the gamma spectrum will not be picked up (see for instance Chapter BW)

... shown that calibration procedure was optimised using PTFE converters (linear ICS)

... adding another diagnostic (converter target, pairs) could constrain this (see Chapter BW)

... shown that better knowledge of exact interaction conditions would constrain measurements more

... shown that a profile screen can be combined with a spectrometer we can look at the ellipticity of the source. This can in the future be interesting to measure the intensity at the interaction (model-independent a0 measurement, otherwise UMSTADTER REF IF NO REFERENCE FROM T BLACKBURN YET)

... shown that by using a dual-axis detector we can follow the decay of the gamma signal and measure its ellipticity. This might help constrain models more (DEPENDS IF TOM PUBLISHED SOMETHING AT THAT POINT).

... in BW campaign we fielded the magnetic chicane, particle tracking from TimePix and single particle detection using a CsI-camera setup. In high intensity non-linear ICS interactions we can produce pairs and the results show we are able to measure events down to the single-particle level (BW Chapter)

... in addition electron spectra were investigated and how their properties affect RR measurements. Other observables are explored in C ARRAN REFS.

... combining the spectral measurement with the electron statistical analysis and other observables we can do better measurements of RR, even at existing sub-PW facilities

... all set for another attempt, for instance using a setup as shown in Figure \ref{Concl:Fig:FutureExp}.

\EliasComm{Make plot (Blender) of a future experiment setup including all the new diagnostics and indicating role of components. Interesting measurements (draw up new experiment plan basically, same as before plus another gamma detector).}
