From left to right: a high intensity laser beam (red) focused with a f40 spherical mirror generates up to $\mathrm  {GeV}$-scale electrons in a gas jet (LWFA). A second laser beam (red) is focused down tightly at the edge of the gas jet by an f2 off-axis parabola to scatter the electron beam shortly after it leaves the jet. The electrons (blue) are being dispersed by a dipole magnet and detected on a scintillating lanex screen (grey).
