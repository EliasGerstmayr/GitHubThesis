	Abstract = {Interaction of relativistic electron beams with high power lasers can both serve as a secondary light source and as a novel diagnostic tool for various beam parameters. For both applications, it is important to understand the dynamics of the inverse Compton scattering mechanism and the dependence of the scattered light's spectral properties on the interacting laser and electron beam parameters. Measurements are easily misinterpreted due to the complex interplay of the interaction parameters. Here we report the potential of inverse Compton scattering as an advanced diagnostic tool by investigating two of the most influential interaction parameters, namely the laser intensity and the electron beam emittance. Established scaling laws for the spectral bandwidth and redshift of the mean scattered photon energy are refined. This allows for a quantitatively well matching prediction of the spectral shape. Driving the interaction to a nonlinear regime, we spectrally resolve the rise of higher harmonic radiation with increasing laser intensity. Unprecedented agreement with 3D radiation simulations is found, showing the good control and characterization of the interaction. The findings advance the interpretation of inverse Compton scattering measurements into a diagnostic tool for electron beams from laser plasma acceleration.},

We were able to obtain a stable laser wire having a beam waist of 14.52Â±0.55 Âµm and a power gain of 220Â±20. This monitor was installed in the ATF damping ring at KEK, and was used to measure its vertical emittance. We report in this paper the development and performance studies of this monitor in detail.}

This monitor is based on the Compton scattering of electrons with a laser light target. A thin and intense laser beam is produced by exciting a Fabryâ€“Perot optical cavity with a CW laser. Various improvements were made to the original setup. First, the effective laser power inside the cavity was increased by an order of magnitude, leading to a drastic increase in a signal-to-background ratio and a decrease in measurement time. Second, readout circuits were modified to separately measure beam sizes of each bunch in a multi-bunch beam. Third, two cavities were installed to measure both horizontal and vertical beam sizes. With this upgraded setup, measurements of electron beam emittance operated in a multi-bunch mode were carried out successfully."
