\contentsline {todo}{\color@fb@x {}{black}{}{green!40}{\leavevmode {\color {green!40}o}}\ SM: This paragraph is important but has ended up waffling a bit. Keep the reader with you. here is how I might try and say the same thing... In the results presented in this thesis gamma rays produced by three methods are characterised. Each generation method requires a slightly different approach to deal with the bremsstrahlung background which are briefly discussed here. 1) Linear ICS (chapter x): The background was characterised by a series of null shots (I.e no scattering laser, but full electron beam). The spectral shape of the background was found to be stable and proportional to the total energy (Qg2) in the electron beam. As linear ICS does not affect the energy of the electron beam this allows the measured electron spectrum on full shots to be used to estimate the bremsstrahlung background on each shot. 2) non linear ICS (chapter y): The background was characterised on a series of null shots and was also found to be proportional to Qg2. Although the energy spectrum is affected by collision with the laser on full shots, the bremsstrahlung sources are likely to be from interaction of electrons with material downstream from the collision point. This means it is reasonable to assume that the background on full shots is determined by the post collision Qg2. 3) bremsstrahlung (chapter z). The background, characterised on shots without the converter in place was much lower than the signal measured on shots with the converter. The background therefore has a negligible affect on the measured spectrum when the converter was used.}{133}{section*.174}

\contentsline {todo}{\color@fb@x {}{black}{}{blue!40}{\leavevmode {\color {blue!40}o}}\ EG: Question to ask Stuart: Do I need to talk about source size and potential divergence here to justify overlap or is it enough to say I assume the overlap. Despite its low divergence the collimated gamma beam will be around $6.2\pm 0.1\tmspace +\thinmuskip {.1667em}\mathrm {mm}$ wide at the interaction point, $865\pm 4.5\tmspace +\thinmuskip {.1667em}\mathrm {mm}$ downstream from the converter target. The X-ray source is much closer to the interaction point and will be smaller at around XX MM NUMBER. The spatial overlap of both photon sources is hence guaranteed on each shot. The temporal overlap is also secured as the North beam is a $40\tmspace +\thinmuskip {.1667em}\mathrm {ps}$ long heater and timing fluctuations at Gemini have been measured to be of order of 10's of $\mathrm {fs}$ \cite {Shalloo_GEMINIDRIFT}.}{256}{section*.359}
