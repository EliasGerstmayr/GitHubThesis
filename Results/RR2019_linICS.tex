Photons scattering off a relativistic electron are Doppler-upshifted due to the relativistic Lorentz boost, converting, for instance, optical photons from a laser into energetic X-rays and gamma radiation. This process is called \textit{inverse Compton scattering} (ICS), \textit{relativistic Thomson scattering} or \textit{Compton backscattering}.
\textit{Linear} inverse Compton scattering, the low-intensity limit of this process, is widely used in conventional accelerators as high-energy radiation source to study nuclear processes \cite{Nakano2001_ICSNuclear}, and as versatile beam diagnostic to measure, for instance, the beam energy \cite{Chouffani2006_ICS_BeamParam,Utsunomiya2014_ICS_BeamEnergy}, position \cite{Sakai2002_ICS_LaserWire}, emittance \cite{Sakai2002_ICS_EMITTANCE} and polarisation \cite{Barber1993_POL,Baylac2002_POL,Weber2018_POL}.

More recently, it has also found increasing application in laser wakefield accelerators (LWFA) \cite{Corde2013_Rad,Albert2016_APP,Downer2018_DiagnosticReview}, for instance, as X-ray source for imaging applications, including high-Z materials \cite{Banerjee2015_ICS_RADIOGRAPHY}. Since the radiation inherits the ultrafast nature of the LWFA electron beam \cite{Lundh2011_BUNCH}, it also has potential as X-ray probe for fast processes like laser-driven shocks in materials \cite{Wood2018_BetatronShock} or structural transitions such as non-thermal melting \cite{Albert2016_APP}.
In the context of LWFA, linear ICS has also been considered as diagnostic to measure properties of the accelerated electron beam \cite{Jochmann2013_ICS_BeamEAngle,Golovin2016_ICS_BeamEmittance,Kramer2018_Gamma}. 

At conventional accelerators and in LWFA experiments, the beam is typically diagnosed by scanning or rastering the laser over multiple shots through the electron beam (see `laser wire' \cite{Alley1996_LaserWire,Leemans1996_ICS_BeamTransLong,Sakai2001_BeamSize,Sakai2002_ICS_EMITTANCE,Sakai2002_ICS_LaserWire,Baylac2002_POL,Honda2005_ICS_LaserWire}). 
In all-optical setups, the laser is focused tightly in order to produce a significant number of X-rays or gamma-rays \cite{Kramer2018_Gamma}. 
In conventional accelerators, the typical beam charges are much higher such that Fabry-Perot cavities excited by a continuous-wave laser can be used \cite{Honda2005_ICS_LaserWire}. 
A statistical characterisation of the electron beam is only meaningful if the beam source is either reproducible, as in conventional setups, or a particle beam transport is used to focus the electron bunch onto a fixed point in space. 
The performance of LWFA sources has improved greatly in the recent years \cite{Mangles2016_LPA_Review}, also in terms of reproducibility and repetition rates, which are key development areas to be competitive with other light sources and accelerator concepts \cite{Albert2016_APP}.

A sufficiently intense laser pulse, on the other hand, can produce a significant yield of scattered photons at a beam diameter comparable to the size of the electron beam or exceeding it. 
In such a setup, the Compton source could act as single-shot diagnostic similar to a beam profile monitor, measuring electron beam pointing, divergence and ellipticity, and their statistical fluctuations. 
The same setup could then be used at high intensities in \textit{nonlinear} inverse Compton scattering where the ellipticity of the emission profile has been proposed as on-shot intensity measurement of the interaction \cite{HarShemesh2012_INTENSITY,Yan2017_ICS,Blackburn2019_ModelIndependentLaser}. 
A statistical characterisation of the electron beam would be a useful tool to discriminate experimental uncertainties, e.g. caused by the intrinsic fluctuations of the wakefield accelerator, and model uncertainties related to radiation reaction.

\section{Chapter Outline}

This Chapter presents results from an experimental campaign undertaken at the \textsc{Gemini} laser system in early 2019, aimed at conducting precision measurements of radiation reaction by colliding highly relativistic electron beams from a laser wakefield accelerator with an intense laser pulse. 
Unfortunately, we were not able to perform interactions at high-intensities as we lost access to the scattering laser beam towards the end of the campaign. 
However, we succeeded in colliding a relativistic electron beam with a defocused laser pulse at $a_0 \sim 0.2-1.0$ over the course of hundreds of shots, and measured the emitted high-energy radiation produced from linear inverse Compton scattering in the process. 
In this Chapter, we demonstrate how to use the properties of the emitted radiation to diagnose both, the scattering laser pulse and the electron beam.

After outlining the experimental layout of the campaign, we proceed with a characterisation of the electron spectra taken at fixed experimental conditions (Section \ref{Chap:linICS:sec:Espec}). These electron beams interacted with the laser pulse and acted as Compton source. 

Then, results from a laser raster scan are presented (Section \ref{Chap:linICS:Sec:RasterScan}): the scattering beam is shifted relative to the electron bunch and the presence or absence of a bright gamma signal is measured on the gamma profile detector to establish the size of the laser beam at the interaction plane.
Here, the electron beam is small and approximately fixed in space so that it acts as a probe rastering the laser beam profile. This technique can be used to corroborate the spatio-temporal electron-laser alignment, and to estimate the change in their relative arrival time required to achieve high-intensity interactions.

Based on the estimated laser beam parameters at the interaction and the characterised electron beams, the spectral shape of the generated radiation is discussed (Section \ref{Chap:linICS:Sec:GammaSpec_A}). This is followed by an estimate of the total number of high-energy photons produced in the interaction (Section \ref{Chap:linICS:Sec:Nphotons}), and how different spectral components of the electron beam contribute to the total yield measured on the gamma-ray detectors (Section \ref{Chap:linICS:Sec:EdepResponse}).
The photon yield is then used to infer the beam size and intensity at the interaction (Section \ref{Chap:linICS:Sec:YieldBeamSize}), and could be used to diagnose the temporal fluctuations in the synchronisation of the laser pulse and the electron beam. Subsequently, the radiation spectrum is inferred for specific example shots (Section \ref{linICS:Chap:Sec:SpectralRetrieval}).

Finally, we discuss the feasibility of this light source as single-shot non-invasive electron beam diagnostic, in particular its ability to measure the beam divergence, pointing and to resolve spatial features of the electron beam (Section \ref{Chap:linICS:Sec:ICS_EbeamDiag}). 

\section{Experimental Setup}
\label{Chap:linICS:sec:ExpSetup}

This experiment was performed at the \textsc{Gemini} facility in 2019 using both laser arms of the dual beam facility.
Figure \ref{LinICS:Fig:SetupBlend} shows a sketch of the relevant components of the setup.

\subsubsection{Laser wakefield accelerator}

The driver beam for the wakefield accelerator was focused by an $f/40$ off-axis parabola (OAP) onto the leading edge of a 15 mm conical supersonic helium gas jet. 
The pulse duration was measured to be $61\pm5\,\mathrm{fs}$ \textsc{fwhm} with an average energy on-target of $12.5 \pm 0.2\,\mathrm{J}$, reaching a peak power of $195\pm3\,\mathrm{TW}$. The size of the focal spot measured $(48.6\pm3.2) \times (39.2\pm1.6)\,\mathrm{\upmu m}$ \textsc{fwhm}, amounting to a peak normalised vector potential of $a_0 = 1.88\pm0.04$ in vacuum\footnote{The focal spot data and FROG trace were analysed by Matthew Streeter (Imperial College)}. The laser pulse was polarised in the horizontal plane.
\vspace{\baselineskip}

The exit of the gas nozzle was positioned $14\pm0.1\,\mathrm{mm}$ below the laser beam axis to avoid damage from the second, more divergent laser beam. A steel razor blade was introduced $4\pm0.1\,\mathrm{mm}$ above the nozzle edge at $- 32.4^\circ\pm 0.3^\circ$ angle in vertical direction relative to the laser axis to produce a shock front. The tip of the blade was inserted $1.2\pm0.1\,\mathrm{mm}$ into the gas flow from the same side that the driver beam entered from. 
The gas target was characterised on-shot by a transverse optical probe synchronised with the driver beam ending in a shadowgraphy and a Mach-Zehnder interferometry setup.
The electron density determined interferometrically\footnote{The interferometry data was evaluated by Cary Colgan (Imperial College)} without inserting the blade was $(1.4 \pm 0.2) \times 10^{18}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$. When inserting the blade, the density profile exhibited a sharp peak in density, a shock, reaching about $(2.4 \pm 1.4) \times 10^{18}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, which is up to twice the ambient density. 
The errors indicate the statistical variation in density rather than the resolution of the retrieval. Especially around the shock front, the retrieval might suffer from systematic errors, that are subject of ongoing analysis: e.g. an angled shock breaking the symmetry of the Abel inversion, intensity modulations from shadowgraphy convolved with shifts in the interference pattern, or if the shock front is spatially not sufficiently resolved.
In addition to the optical probe, the gas target and the recombination light emitted by the plasma channel were imaged by a Canon DSLR camera from the side and a CCD camera from the roof of the chamber.

\caption[Sketch of experimental setup to measure radiation from linear inverse Compton scattering.]{Sketch of the experimental setup to measure radiation from linear inverse Compton scattering. The first laser pulse (red, left) is focused down by an $f/40$ OAP into a gas jet and accelerates electrons (blue) from LWFA, where the density perturbation induced by the blade affects the injection mechanism. A second laser is focused down by an $f/2$ OAP and counter-propagates with the electron beam. Gamma radiation produced from linear inverse Compton scattering (green) is emitted in the propagation direction of the electron beam and is measured downstream by a scintillating profile screen and a stack of scintillating crystals used as spectrometer (right). A solid target behind the $f/2$ OAP can be used to convert the electron beam into an energetic source of bremsstrahlung to calibrate the gamma diagnostics. The electrons are dispersed horizontally by a permanent dipole magnet onto a set of Lanex screens. The accelerator, the interaction point and the magnet are in vacuum, whereas the measurement screens and gamma diagnostics are located at air separated by a thin vacuum window (orange).} 
\label{LinICS:Fig:SetupBlend}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Scattering beam}

A second laser pulse was focused by an $f/2$ off-axis parabola (OAP) at the opposite edge of the gas jet in a head-on geometry. The $f/2$ OAP had a 21-mm-diameter hole in the centre that allowed the electrons, laser light and radiation on-axis to propagate through. A plastic ring of outer radius $28\,\mathrm{mm}$ and inner radius $11\,\mathrm{mm}$ was fitted around the hole to protect the optic and the laser chain upstream from laser light that was potentially scattered or strongly defocused in the plasma. This reduced the energy on-target by 16 percent assuming a perfect top-hat laser profile and that the collimated beam incident on the OAP had a diameter of $150\,\mathrm{mm}$. To protect the optic from potential debris, a thin plastic layer with anti-reflective coating (`pellicle') and a suitable hole was attached to the mount of the OAP. The on-shot energy of the laser after the compressor was $9.73\pm 0.15\,\mathrm{J}$ and $8.17\pm0.13\,\mathrm{J}$ on-target due to the hole in the OAP. In the dataset presented, the beam diameter at the interaction was estimated through a raster scan to be $400\pm100\,\mathrm{\upmu m}$ (see Section \ref{Chap:linICS:Sec:RasterScan}). This translates into a normalised vector potential of $a_0 \sim 0.28 \pm 0.04$ at a pulse duration of $45\,\mathrm{fs}$. The laser pulse was linearly polarised in the vertical plane, cross-polarised to the wakefield driver beam.

\subsubsection{Two-beam timing}

Both laser beams were synchronised to each other in vacuum to an accuracy of $\pm30\,\mathrm{fs}$ using spatial interferometry \cite{Cole2018_RR}. A 90-degree dielectric knife-edge prism (Thorlabs MRAK25-E03) was inserted at the interaction point, deflecting both beams collinearly onto the CCD chip of a camera (AVT Manta G-033B) equipped with a $\times10$ long-working-distance infinity-corrected microscope objective (Mitutoyo NIR). 
The different radii of curvature of both beams, especially near the focus of the $f/2$ beam, produced a circular interference pattern when the beams were overlapped in space and time (see Section \ref{Methods:Sec:DualBeamTiming}).

\subsubsection{Particle and Radiation diagnostics}

The radiation, the remaining driver laser and the electrons propagated through the hole in the $f/2$ OAP into a large aperture [$10\,\mathrm{cm} \times 30\,\mathrm{cm}$ (vertical $\times$ horizontal)] permanent dipole magnet\footnote{designed, and assembly and positioning supervised by Dominik Hollatz (Jena)} of integrated magnetic field strength $\int B(x) \mathrm{d}x = 0.35\,\mathrm{Tm}$. 
The electrons were dispersed in the horizontal plane. Electrons of an energy below 220 MeV collided with the yoke of the magnet, resulting in an effective low-energy cut-off. The dispersed beam left the vacuum chamber through a two-layer wide-aperture vacuum window\footnote{designed and tested by the Mechanical Engineering Division at the CLF, in particular Daniel Treverrow.} of dimensions $580 \,\mathrm{mm} \,\times\, 70\,\mathrm{mm}$ (horizontal $\times$ vertical). The layer facing the vacuum consisted of $25\,\mathrm{\upmu m}$ of Kapton, the outside layer is $375\,\mathrm{\upmu m}$ of Kevlar (chemical equation $C_{14} H_{14} N_2 O_4$, density $\rho = 1.44\,\mathrm{g/cm}^3$ \cite{Kevlar}) providing additional mechanical stability and fibre support that acted as mechanical fail-safe. A scintillating sensitive Lanex screen (Kodak Biomax) was placed just after the window, at $1.61\,\mathrm{m}$ distance downstream of the interaction point, to measure the spectrum of the dispersed electron beam. The screen also extended beyond the laser and radiation axis. The light and thin material of the window and the short distance to the Lanex screen minimised the impact of multiple small-angle scattering on the measurement \cite{Moller1932_Moller,Bethe1953_Moliere}.
A second Lanex screen (Kodak Standard) measured the spectrum $700\pm1\,\mathrm{mm}$ further downstream ($2.31\,\mathrm{m}$ from the interaction point) and can in conjunction with the first screen be used to account for the pointing of the beam \cite{Clayton2010_ION,Soloviev2011_TWOSCREEN}.
The screens were each imaged by a cooled 16-bit CCD camera (Andor Neo) equipped with a suitable objective and a bandpass filter transmitting light of wavelength $546\pm10\,\mathrm{nm}$. %A third camera images a small region of interest on the first screen.
\vspace{\baselineskip}

High-Z metal converter targets (bismuth, tungsten, iron) were fixed to a $1.6\,\mathrm{mm}$ plastic (PTFE) base and mounted on a motorised linear stage between the mount of the $f/2$ OAP and the dipole magnet. The targets were driven into the beam path to intercept the electron beam and to produce gamma radiation from bremsstrahlung \cite{Glinec2005_Brems} to calibrate the gamma-ray diagnostics \cite{Behm2018_Gamma}. 
The high-Z targets enabled efficient conversion of the electron beam energy into radiation, but did not allow measuring the electron spectrum at the same time. The PTFE base itself was also used as converter that was less efficient in terms of radiation yield but allowed a synchronous measurement of the electron and gamma-ray beam. 

Radiation traversed the magnet on the laser axis, then passed through a $120\,\mathrm{\upmu m}$ aluminium laser beam block that terminates the wakefield driver beam, and through the Kevlar-Kapton window mentioned before. Bright radiation in the right bandwidth was also captured by the Lanex screen as it extended beyond the laser and radiation axis. An array of $45 \times 45$ scintillating caesium-iodide crystals doped with thallium (CsI:Tl) of dimensions $1\,\mathrm{mm} \times 1\,\mathrm{mm} \times 10 \,\mathrm{mm}$ measured the profile of the radiation $700 \pm 1\,\mathrm{mm}$ downstream from the plane of the first Lanex screen. The crystals were each separated transversely by a $0.2\,\mathrm{mm}$ thick $TiO_2$ coating and were held together by a $TiO_2$ front plate of thickness $0.5\mm$. The stack covered a field of view corresponding to a cone of half opening angle $11.7\,\mathrm{mrad}$. The spatial resolution including the coating separating the individual crystals was then $1.2\,\mathrm{mm}/2.31\,\mathrm{m} = 0.52\,\mathrm{mrad}$.
$704 \pm 1\,\mathrm{mm}$ further downstream from the profile screen another elongated array of caesium-iodide crystals was positioned to measure the spectrum of the gamma radiation. Both scintillator arrays, the profile screen and the spectrometer, were imaged using cooled 14-bit EMCCD cameras (Andor iXons). The diagnostics are described in more detail in Section \ref{Methods:Sec:GammaDiags}.

\section{Characterisation of Electron Spectra}
\label{Chap:linICS:sec:Espec}

The colour scale indicates the charge per MeV in the beam.}
\label{linICS:Figs:fixed_waterfall}
\end{figure}

In this experiment, the electrons were injected through density perturbations in the supersonic gas flow, which were introduced by a steel blade \cite{Schmid2010_SHOCK} and subsequently accelerated to relativistic energies via laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA). The electron spectrum was measured by scintillating Lanex screens as part of a magnetic spectrometer setup (see \cite{ColeThesis,PoderThesis} and Section \ref{Chap:Methods:Sec:Espec}). Here, we will only consider the measurements from the first Lanex screen and ignore potential errors in the inferred electron energy that result from pointing fluctuations \cite{Clayton2010_ION,Soloviev2011_TWOSCREEN}.

We consider a dataset that consists of a series of shots taken at nominally fixed experimental conditions to investigate fluctuations in the accelerator performance. 
The electron beams measured on these shots were collided with a second laser pulse to produce radiation from inverse Compton scattering, which will be analysed in more detail in the following sections.
The dataset consists of 386 shots, taken at constant backing pressure of the gas jet and fixed blade position ($1.2\pm0.1\,\mathrm{mm}$ into the gas flow from the entry point of the driver beam). 
Figure \ref{linICS:Figs:fixed_waterfall} shows a waterfall plot of the 1D electron spectra integrated in non-dispersion direction. 
Despite nominally constant conditions, the properties of the electron beams vary strongly from shot-to-shot and take on a wide range of shapes, maximum energies and energy spreads. 
Figure \ref{linICS:Figs:Elec_example} provides a few examples of the 2D electron spectra from this dataset.
The spectral bandwidth of the beams varies strongly with some exhibiting an almost flat spectrum spanning hundreds of MeV (see 4 left panels in Figure \ref{linICS:Figs:Elec_example}). 
These spectrally very wide electron beams show signatures of strong transverse oscillations, which indicate their potential to act as a bright betatron source \cite{Corde2013_Rad}. 
In other instances, electron beams with narrow energy spread around $1\,\mathrm{GeV}$ are measured (right panels in Figure \ref{linICS:Figs:Elec_example}). 

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[trim={4cm 0 1cm 0}, clip, width=1.0\columnwidth]{Example_Espec_CollisionMontage_V4.png}
\caption[Examples of 2D electron spectra measured in the experiment.]{Examples of 2D electron spectra measured in the experiment.

The amplitude of the projections is set to the maximum within the respective panel and is not indicative of the relative charge between the panels.}
\label{linICS:Figs:Elec_example}
\end{figure}

The striking variability of the electrons produced at seemingly fixed experiment conditions is not consistent with experimental results reported from other LWFA experiments at other laser systems using shock injection \cite{Schmid2010_SHOCK}. These setups typically provide reproducible electron beams with narrow energy spread \cite{Schmid2010_SHOCK,Buck2013_SHOCK,Swanson2017_SHOCK,Tsai2018_SHOCK}.

\label{linICS:Figs:Elec_histogram}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{linICS:Figs:Elec_histogram} summarises the key properties of the electron beams in form of histograms showing charge, maximum electron energy, vertical (non-dispersion axis) divergence, beam pointing and on-shot laser energy of the wakefield driver beam.
The maximum energy of the electron beam, here defined as the energy when the spectral intensity reaches 10 percent of its peak value, measured on average $944\pm139\,\mathrm{MeV}$ (error indicates standard deviation based on normal distribution), with some shots reaching up to $1.3\,\mathrm{GeV}$. The charge of the beam varied in particular due to the varying spectral range of the bunch with a median of $225(+67/\!{-}56)\,\mathrm{pC}$, where the error interval indicates the quarter and three quarter quantile, respectively, as the distribution is not normal.
The divergence of the beams was measured to be $2.1(+0.6/\!{-}0.5)\,\mathrm{mrad}$, using the same convention as for the charge, and the vertical position of the beam centroid was fluctuating by $2.2\,\mathrm{mrad}$, assuming a normal distribution. The on-shot laser energy was on average $12.3\pm0.5\,\mathrm{J}$, assuming a normal distribution. The linear correlation coefficient for the laser energy and the maximum electron energy is $0.03$ which indicates that the quantities are not correlated. This is consistent with shock injection, where the position of the density perturbation, the injection point, determines the maximum energy, and also indicates that the injection point varies from shot to shot, potentially due to a variation in the shock position and angle. The charge in the beam is only moderately correlated with the laser energy at a coefficient of $0.29$.
\vspace{\baselineskip}

The wide range of electron beams produced in this setup is interesting in the context of radiation production from linear inverse Compton scattering (ICS). 
Since the properties of the beams this accelerator generates vary strongly, the radiation these electron beams are capable to produce in a well-defined linear ICS interaction will also vary significantly. 
This means that this accelerator is in principle also able to produce a wide range of radiation spectra from broadband to strongly peaked radiation.
However, an increased control over the accelerator would be required to shape the spectral emission and develop a tunable radiation source that can be optimised for a specific application. 
An improved stability of the shock position could facilitate this control.

\section{Laser raster scan}
\label{Chap:linICS:Sec:RasterScan}
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{RasterScan_Shadowgraphy_CloseUp_annotated.pdf}
\caption[Shadowgram of the plasma channel with the focusing f/2 laser cone.]{Cut-out of a shadowgram of the gas jet taken with the transverse optical probe (horizontal plane). The wakefield driver beam enters the gas jet from the right side and generates a plasma channel. The dark line on the right side results from a shock front. The second scattering beam is focused tightly into the plasma from the left side, where a converging cone becomes visible. The spatial scale is indicated in the bottom right corner.}
\label{linICS:Figs:ShadowgraphyRaster}
\end{figure}


The laser pulses from the two laser arms were overlapped in space and time using a photodiode and spatial interferometry in vacuum (see Section \ref{Methods:Sec:DualBeamTiming}). 
The focal plane of the scattering $f/2$ beam was positioned in the gas jet for alignment purposes. 
On full-power shots, the cone of the $f/2$ laser pulse focusing into the plasma is visible on the transverse (horizontal plane) shadowgraphy diagnostic (see Figure \ref{linICS:Figs:ShadowgraphyRaster}, left side) along with the plasma channel from the wakefield driver beam and the shock leading to the injection of electrons into the wakefield accelerator (dark line in the plasma channel on the right side). 
\vspace{\baselineskip}

On full-power shots with both laser beams and an electron beam produced by the wakefield accelerator, we consistently measured a bright circular or oval signal on the gamma profile screen indicating an interaction of the laser pulse and the electron beam (inverse Compton scattering). 
The consistency of the collisions implies that the laser beam is much larger than the electron beam, and the combined fluctuations in the relative position of the scattering beam and the electron beam. 
This in turn indicates a systematic offset of the interaction point from the focal plane of the $f/2$ laser pulse as the laser pulse and the electron bunch would there be of comparable size and are expected to miss each other frequently \cite{Cole2018_RR}.
% that we attempted to achieve with the alignment and timing procedure,

\label{linICS:Figs:GammaProfileRaster}
\end{figure}


To establish the transverse size of the scattering laser pulse at the interaction point, the scattering laser beam was shifted horizontally by translating the position of the $f/2$ off-axis parabola (OAP) in $50\,\mathrm{\upmu m}$ steps, assuming that the laser beam translates by the same amount for small motions. 
The remaining experimental parameters and the alignment of the wakefield driver beam were kept constant during this procedure. 
At least 5 full-power dual-beam shots were taken at each OAP position. 
In some cases, more shots were required to accumulate 5 suitable data points, when at least one of the lasers was not firing or no electron beam was measured on-shot. 
The response of the gamma profile screen was recorded and the number of visibly bright signals was noted down. Subsequently, the OAP was then translated again by $50\,\mathrm{\upmu m}$ and the procedure was repeated. Figure \ref{linICS:Figs:GammaProfileRaster} shows a montage of the gamma profile screens at each position of a horizontal scan in the OAP position, where the relative position from the established beam centre is indicated on the $x$-axis. Figure \ref{linICS:Figs:GammaProfileRasterCounts}, on the other hand, shows the corresponding average integrated gamma yields on the profile screen and the fraction of successful collisions at each position. The absence of bright signals at two consecutive OAP positions was deemed to be a suitable indication of lacking overlap of the laser beam and the electron bunch. The distance mapped by this method includes the diameter of the laser beam at the plane of the interaction, the size of the electron beam, and the relative pointing fluctuations between them. Since the finite step size in the OAP translation ($50\microns$) is much larger than the expected electron beam size $\sim\microns$ and the relative pointing fluctuations ($\sim \mrad \times \mathrm{mm}$), the dominant measurement error on the transverse size of the laser beam is the step size.

\label{linICS:Figs:GammaProfileRasterCounts}
\end{figure}

In the raster scan presented in Figure \ref{linICS:Figs:GammaProfileRaster} and Figure \ref{linICS:Figs:GammaProfileRasterCounts}, the interaction region and hence, following our argument, the combined size of the laser beam and the electron beam along with variations in the relative beam pointing was $400\pm100 \,\mathrm{\upmu m}$. 
The integrated gamma yield in Figure \ref{linICS:Figs:GammaProfileRasterCounts} also shows signs of a drop in intensity throughout the scan, potentially when crossing the hole in the beam. 
At an energy on-target of $9.73\pm0.15\,\mathrm{J}$, this amounts to a normalised vector potential of $a_0 \approx 0.28 \pm 0.04$, where we assumed a perfect flat-top beam profile and hence ignored the reduction of the energy in the beam due to the hole in the $f/2$ OAP, as this does not affect the local photon density in the near-field. 
For an $f/2$ geometry, this also indicates that the interaction plane is at $\sim1.1\pm0.1\,\mathrm{mm}$ distance from the focal plane. 
Based on the alignment procedure in the experiment, we suspect that the interaction occurs prior to the focus of the scattering beam (left hand side in Figure \ref{linICS:Figs:ShadowgraphyRaster}). 
% spatial fluctuations due to pointing variations of the laser with a 
The interaction still takes place in the plasma, so that pointing fluctuations are reduced and the electron beam is only $\sim \mathrm{\upmu m}$ in size \cite{Weingartner2012_BUNCH}.
Similarly, off-axis distributions resulting from betatron oscillations are small with amplitudes $r_\beta \sim \mathrm{\upmu m}$ \cite{Corde2013_Rad}. 
Since the beam pointing of the $f/2$ beam is demagnified due to the short focal distance, the raster scan mainly reflects the dimensions of the scattering beam and this is hence a suitable method to determine the size of the laser beam.

If we assume that this method successfully determines the size of the laser pulse at the interaction plane, we can also pinpoint its centre by shifting the OAP to the central position between the outermost OAP positions on which a significant gamma signal was measured. 
By repeating this procedure in the vertical axis, we can then centre the scattering laser pulse on the electron beam accurately in both transverse dimensions, provided that the relative pointing fluctuations and the electron beam size are negligible as assumed. 
The accuracy of this procedure can be improved by repeating the steps in the first transverse dimension in a third pass and by reducing the step size of the OAP translation. 
The principle of this `raster scan' resembles the `laser wire' or spatial cross-correlation technique where a scattering laser beam is focused tightly onto an electron beam to produce energetic from linear inverse Compton scattering and to diagnose the electron beam \cite{Alley1996_LaserWire,Leemans1996_ICS_BeamTransLong,Okugi1999_WireScanner_Emittance,Baylac2002_POL,Sakai2001_BeamSize,Sakai2002_ICS_LaserWire,Sakai2002_ICS_EMITTANCE,Honda2005_ICS_LaserWire,Chen2013_ICS,Jochmann2013_ICS_BeamEAngle,Utsunomiya2014_ICS_BeamEnergy,Golovin2016_ICS_BeamEmittance,Kramer2018_Gamma}. The laser focus is typically smaller than the electron beam and the transverse size of the electron beam can be determined by translating the laser focus over multiple shots. The emission spectrum and angular distribution of the backscattered radiation can also be used as diagnostic for other beam properties. The name `laser wire' is derived from the physical wire scanners that were used as beam diagnostics in conventional accelerator facilities \cite{Okugi1999_WireScanner_Emittance}. In the case presented here, the electron beam, however, is much smaller than the laser beam. Even though the laser pulse is translated and the electron remains approximately fixed, here the electron beam effectively acts as the probe and diagnoses the laser beam at the interaction plane, inversely to the laser wire.


\iffalse
The gas jet expands from its nozzle opening diameter of $15$ mm to a length of approximately $17.3$ mm (measured by the length of the plasma channel on the shadowgram). This means based on this scan the interaction point is defined as intended by the alignment procedure, the inner edge of the gas nozzle, but the gas jet has expanded. In addition, the focal plane of the laser has changed. We have to keep in mind that translating the OAP in longitudinal direction does not change the intensity of the interaction at first order as we shift the interaction plane along with the intensity plane when doing so. If we want to change the intensity at the interaction we have to change the relative delay of the two laser pulses.
In brief, shifting the longitudinal OAP position and the focal plane in space only changes the plane of interaction at roughly the same intensity, whereas shifting the delay of the beams shifts both the interaction plane and the intensity. The mismatch of the interaction plane and the focal plane might be due to a misunderstanding of these two mechanisms and we mistakenly `compensated' for the shift in focus and fixed the interaction plane, rather than the intensity at the interaction.

\subsubsection{Laser raster scan as tool to achieving high-intensity interactions}

This spatial correlation technique determines the size of the laser beam at the interaction, its centre and, knowing the focusing geometry, the plane of the interaction. As a result, we can not only characterise the properties of the beam at the interaction, but we can use this information to change the relative arrival time of both laser pulses to shift the interaction towards a more intense region of the focusing beam. 
The procedure can then be repeated at the new interaction plane to confirm that the laser pulse is indeed smaller and more intense (see Figure \ref{linICS:Figs:RasterTemporalTranslationIdea}). 
When the beam size of the scattering laser pulse and the electron bunch become comparable, we also expect a particularly high gamma-ray yield due to the high laser intensity but also more frequently `missed' shots, when the laser pulse and the electron beam pass by each other as the pointing fluctuations are comparable with their sizes.

If we perform this raster scan at a high resolution (small step size) in both transverse dimensions, at various focal planes (multi-dimensional raster scan) and with multiple shots at each position, we immediately see that this requires a large number of shots in total. A route to reducing the number of required shots to identify the ideal high-intensity conditions is using a Bayesian inference model and to automate this process. Bayesian inference models can reduce the number of data points required for optimisation in a multi-dimension scan \cite{Kirschner2019_Bayesian,Edelen2018_ML}. For any interaction far away from the focus, i.e. $z \gg z_R$, the key optimisation quantity would be the gamma ray yield measured with the profile screen, potentially also correlated with the electron beam charge and energy if these quantities fluctuate strongly (see Chapter \ref{Chap:RR15}). 
Closer to the focus, we would have to consider the number of successful collisions as well as part of the algorithm. 
Machine learning has been used, for instance, in different forms for optimisation and alignment procedures in conventional \cite{Emma2018_ML} and plasma-based accelerators \cite{Streeter2018_TEMPFEEDBACK}, whereas automated control of laser pulses is widely used in laser laboratories for alignment and optimisation purposes. 
The advantage of this method for future measurements would be that it would facilitate taking large amounts of data (precision measurement), which is required to generate a large confidence and to outweigh statistical fluctuations of the beam. The algorithm ideally also corrects drifts in alignment and timing automatically.

Unfortunately, the final step of shifting the interaction plane to the high-intensity focus of the scattering laser pulse was not possible in the experiment. A lens in the beam expander telescope of the scattering beam broke during this dataset and we were not able to continue the campaign with dual-beam shots and potential high-intensity collisions.
Nonetheless, we were able to show consistent overlap in space and time and a good control over the spatio-temporal alignment. The laser raster scan promises to become a useful technique to estimate the laser intensity at the interaction plane and to achieve high-intensity collisions in a future measurement of radiation reaction systematically.


\section{Gamma spectra from inverse Compton scattering}
\label{Chap:linICS:Sec:GammaSpec_A}

A photon of energy $\epsilon_{ph}$ that is scattered off a relativistic electron is Doppler up-shifted due to the relativistic Lorentz boost. The energy of the scattered photon, $\epsilon_{X}$, is given by \cite{Esarey1993_NT}:
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{X} \approx \epsilon_{ph}\times\frac{2(1-\cos \theta)\gamma^2}{1+a^2_0/2 + \gamma^2 \theta^2_0},
\label{linICS:eqns:full_linICS}
\end{equation}
where $\theta$ is the angle between the electron and the incoming photon, $a_0$ is the normalised vector potential and $\theta_0$ is the observer angle relative to the propagation direction of the electron.

The electron beams shown in Section \ref{Chap:linICS:sec:Espec} were collided with a laser pulse at an intensity of $a_0 \sim 0.28$, as estimated in the previous section (Section \ref{Chap:linICS:Sec:RasterScan}). As $a_0 < 1$, we can ignore at first order the contribution of higher harmonic radiation and only consider the fundamental harmonic from linear inverse Compton scattering \cite{Esarey1993_NT}. Since $a^2_0 \ll 1$, we can also ignore the term $a^2_0/2$ in the denominator, which accounts for red-shifting of the radiation when the longitudinal component of the electron motion becomes significant (see Section \ref{Theory:Sec:SingleParticle:FigOfEight} for `figure-of-eight motion').

\textsc{Gemini} has a wavelength of $(800\pm15)\,\mathrm{nm}$ \cite{Galletti2016_GeminiBandwidth}, with a corresponding photon energy, $\epsilon_{ph}=(1.55\pm0.03)\,\mathrm{eV}$. The bandwidth of the laser introduces a spread in the photon energy of $\Delta \epsilon_{ph} \sim 0.06\,\mathrm{eV}$ or $\Delta \epsilon_{ph}/\epsilon_{ph} < 4\%$, which we will ignore in the following.

For a beam focused by an $f/2$ optic, the angle between the outer rays and the central axis, $\Delta \theta$, is up to 14.48 degrees which corresponds to $<2$ percent spread in energy. Since the electron beam ($w_0 \sim \microns$) only interacts with a small fraction of the full beam with radius $r$, i.e. $\pi w^2_0/\pi r^2 \ll 1$, the rays in the interaction region are approximately collinear and this contribution can be ignored as well. A systematic shift of the radiation by 3 percent due to the relative pointing of the electron beam and the laser pulse within this solid angle is also negligible for our considerations ($\Delta \epsilon_X <1\MeV$ at $30\MeV$).

In linear ICS, scattered photons will be emitted in a narrow cone of divergence $\sim 1/\gamma \ll 1$ \cite{Corde2013_Rad}.
The observation angle, on the other hand, introduces a strong position-dependent modulation of the emitted energy within the emission cone as it is paired with the Lorentz factor, $\gamma$, in $(\gamma\theta_0)^2$.

Here, the electron beams are in most cases confined to a divergence cone of few milliradians. For a beam of divergence $4\,\mathrm{mrad}$, the difference introduced by the electron angles in the $\cos\theta$ term, assuming a collimated light source, is less than $0.001\%$, which means that we can ignore a broadening of the spectrum from electron angles as well. The divergence is typically larger than the emission cone $1/\gamma$, such that the total emission loses its strong correlation of position and energy, but the modulation of all emission cones overlap and merge. As a result, we assume that the emission spectrum is on average homogeneously distributed over the profile, maybe with exception of the borders.

The lines are calculated using Equation \eqref{linICS:Eqs:SimpleLinICSEX}, which ignores energy broadening or reductions due to redshifting, the laser bandwidth, and relative angles between the electron beam and laser pulse. The dashed line indicates the low-energy cut-off in the electron spectrometer at 220 MeV.}
\label{linICS:fig:ElecEToEgamma}
\end{figure}

Lastly, for $\gamma \sim 2500$ ($\epsilon \sim 1.3\,\mathrm{GeV}$) and $a_0 = 0.3$
\begin{equation}
\psi = \gamma^2 a_0 \frac{2 r_e \omega}{3c} \ll 1,
\end{equation}
which indicates that radiation reaction effects are negligible and the interaction with the laser pulse does not perturb the electron beam significantly as a whole \cite{Thomas2012_LL,Albert2016_APP}.
Combining these assumptions and considering a head-on collision ($\theta = 180^\circ$), Equation \eqref{linICS:eqns:full_linICS} above simplifies to
\begin{equation}
\boxed{\epsilon_X \approx \frac{4\gamma^2 \epsilon_{ph}}{1 + (\gamma \theta_0)^2},}
\label{linICS:Eqs:SimpleLinICSEX}
\end{equation}
with a maximum energy of
\begin{equation}
\boxed{\epsilon_{X,max} \approx 4\gamma^2 \epsilon_{ph}.}
\label{linICS:Eqs:SimpleLinICSEX_MAX}
\end{equation}

Based on the simplified Equation \eqref{linICS:Eqs:SimpleLinICSEX_MAX} above, we then obtain a quadratic one-to-one mapping of the electron energy to a corresponding maximum gamma-ray energy (see Figure \ref{linICS:fig:ElecEToEgamma} (blue)). 
Overall, we will integrate Equation \eqref{linICS:Eqs:SimpleLinICSEX} over the observation angle, $\theta_0$, to obtain the full emission spectrum.

We assumed $a_0 \ll 1$ for all spectra.}
\label{linICS:fig:ElecEToEgamma_Examples}
\end{figure}

Since the properties of the electron beam vary strongly in this experiment, we also expect the spectrum of the radiation produced from linear ICS to reflect this behaviour. 
Here the cross section is independent of the electron energy \cite{Albert2016_APP}, such that the spectral shape of the electron beam is to some extent preserved in the gamma spectrum. 
Figure \ref{linICS:fig:ElecEToEgamma_Examples} shows two examples of electron spectra (top) and the corresponding gamma-ray spectra calculated with Equation \ref{linICS:Eqs:SimpleLinICSEX} (bottom). 
The first electron beam is spectrally very broad (red) with significant spectral intensity spread from below the measurement threshold of $220\,\mathrm{MeV}$ up to $1200\,\mathrm{MeV}$, resulting in a gamma-ray spectrum spanning few to $35\,\mathrm{MeV}$ with a peak around $8\MeV$. 
The other beam (blue) is strongly peaked at just under $1.2\,\mathrm{GeV}$ with narrow energy spread of $< 10\%$, which has the potential to be converted into a gamma-ray spectrum peaked at $31\,\mathrm{MeV}$.
The dashed and dottes lines in Figure \ref{linICS:fig:ElecEToEgamma_Examples} (bottom) indicate that the accuracy of the calculated gamma spectra would be improved by including additional broadening effects. 
However, the differences are small and the leading order effect remains the $(\gamma_0\theta)^2$ term in Equation \eqref{linICS:Eqs:SimpleLinICSEX}.
We expect significant deviations due to redshifting and higher harmonic radiation once $a_0\rightarrow 1$.


\section{Number of scattered photons}
\label{Chap:linICS:Sec:Nphotons}

Based on the conditions in the experiment and the inferred intensity at the interaction (see Section \ref{Chap:linICS:Sec:RasterScan}), the interaction is accurately described by linear ICS in its classical Thomson limit (see Section \ref{Theory:Sec:LinearICS}).
The total number of scattered photons or the number of gamma-rays, $N_X$, produced in the interaction of the laser pulse with an electron beam of size $w_0$ is then given by \cite{Albert2016_APP}
\begin{equation}
\boxed{N_X = \frac{\sigma_T}{\pi w^2_0} N_{ph} N_e,}
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_T = 6.65 \times 10^{-29}\,\mathrm{m}^{2}$ is the Thomson scattering cross-section, $N_e$ the number of electrons, and $N_{ph}$ is the number of photons in the same area. In this limit, the cross-section and the total number of produced photons are independent of the electron and photon energy.

Since the laser beam is much larger than the electron bunch, we assume that the entire electron bunch passes through the laser pulse and that all electrons encounter the same photon density, hence also contribute equally to the total emitted radiation as the cross-section is constant across the energies. 
As a result, the number of electrons, $N_e$, is obtained by dividing the beam charge measured on-shot, $Q$, by the electron charge, i.e. $N_e = Q/e$.

In order to determine the number of photons, $N_{ph}$, sharing the interaction volume, we will make the following assumptions.
The Rayleigh length, $z_R$, of an $f/2$ beam is approximately $2.5 \lambda f^2_\# \approx 8\,\mathrm{\upmu m}$.
At a diameter of $400\pm100\,\mathrm{\upmu m}$, the beam is at $\sim 1100\pm 275 \mathrm{\upmu m}$ distance from the focal plane, which corresponds to $> 100 z_R$, so that the laser beam is in its near field at this plane. 
As discussed before, we ignore relative angles between the laser and the electron beam. 
As the duration of the laser pulse and the electron bunch \cite{Lundh2011_BUNCH} are short, the duration over which the interaction occurs is also brief. As a result, we can ignore focusing effects and the electrons encounter a static photon field.
%We will also ignore focusing effects, as the duration of the interaction is short due to the short duration of the laser pulse and the electron bunch \cite{Lundh2011_BUNCH} to avoid significant changes in intensity, such that the electrons encounter a static photon field. 
The number of photons overlapping with an electron beam of transverse area $\pi w^2_0$, $N_{ph}$, is given by the laser energy in this area divided by the energy of a single photon, $\epsilon_{ph}$. Assuming a homogeneous flat-top laser profile, with exception of the hole in the OAP, the energy in this area is simply given by the fraction this area holds relative to the total beam area multiplied by the total energy in the laser pulse, $\epsilon_J$:
\begin{equation}
N_{ph} = \left[\frac{\epsilon_J}{\epsilon_{ph}} \frac{\pi w^2_0}{\pi r^2}\right],
\label{Chap:linICS:Eqn:Nph_subst}
\end{equation}
where $r$ is the full radius of the laser beam at the plane of the interaction.
Note that $\epsilon_J$ is the total energy in the laser pulse measured on-shot.
This neglects the reduction due to the hole in the OAP, since this does not affect the local photon density of the laser pulse far away from the focal plane and sufficiently far away from the hole in the beam.
We then obtain for the number of scattered photons, $N_X$:
\begin{align}
N_X &= \frac{\sigma_T}{\pi w^2_0} \left[\frac{\epsilon_J}{\epsilon_{ph}} \frac{\pi w^2_0}{\pi r^2}\right] \left[\frac{Q}{e}\right],\\ \nonumber
&= \frac{\sigma_T}{\pi r^2}\left[ \frac{\epsilon_J}{\epsilon_{ph}}\right] \left[ \frac{Q}{e}\right].
\end{align}
The region of the interaction defined by the electron beam size, $w_0$, cancels out as the photon density is in this approximation constant across any region and only depends on the size of the full laser beam, $r$, and its total energy content, $\epsilon_J$.
We can then write in useful units:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{N_X = 5.32 \times 10^{10}\times  \epsilon_J [J] \times Q [100pC] \times r[\mu m]^{-2}.}
\label{Chap:linICS:Eqn:NX_UsefulUnits}
\end{equation}
For the conditions measured or inferred in this experiment ($\epsilon_J = 9.73\pm0.15$, $Q=239\pm92\,\mathrm{pC}$ and $r=200\,\mathrm{\upmu m}$), this equation estimates that on average $(3.1 \pm 1.2) \times 10^{7}$ photons are scattered in total, $(75\pm8)\%$ of which at an energy $\epsilon_X > 1\MeV$. This is of comparable order of magnitude as reported for similar Compton experiments and bright betatron sources \cite{Kneip2010_BETATRON,Chen2013_BETATRON}, where we can assume that the radiation has a pulse duration and source size comparable to the electron beam.
\vspace{\baselineskip}

However, considering the experimental parameters, it becomes clear that a linear Compton source could be achieved in a much more economical way by scaling down the energy and the beam size at the interaction, whilst still preserving a permanent overlap within the shot-to-shot fluctuations of the laser and the accelerator. Assuming a fixed charge in the electron beam, the number of scattered photons then only depends on the ratio of the laser energy and the beam size $\propto \epsilon_J/r^2$. By reducing the beam radius from $200\,\mathrm{\upmu m}$ to $25\,\mathrm{\upmu m}$, a factor of $8$, the corresponding energy in the scattering beam can be reduced by a factor of $64$, to about $150\,\mathrm{mJ}$, to produce the same number of photons as before. Using an $f/2$ OAP as in this case, the plane of the interaction would be more than 10 Rayleigh lengths, $z_R$, away from the focal plane and which is still in the near-field of the laser, where the profile is flat and smooth, such that any changes in response would predominantly reflect the properties of the electron beam.

\section{Energy-dependent detector response}
\label{Chap:linICS:Sec:EdepResponse}

In the previous sections, we calculated how an electron spectrum translates via linear inverse Compton scattering (or relativistic Thomson scattering) into a gamma spectrum, and estimated the number of high-energy photons produced in such an interaction, finding that the cross-section in this regime is independent of the electron or gamma-ray energy, respectively.

However, whilst the cross-section for an interaction is independent of energy and, as a result, also the number of emitted photons per electron and energy band, the contribution to the yield measured on the gamma profile detector will not necessarily be constant across different energies. The gamma profile detector used in this experiment is not a calorimeter and only absorbs a fraction of the total radiation passing through it. Since there is a range of mechanisms coming into play at the tens of MeV photon energy range, the energy deposition in the profile screen was simulated using GEANT4 \cite{GEANT4}. 

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[trim={4.8cm 0 5cm 0}, clip, width=0.8\columnwidth]{Edep_Jena_1_100_MeV_V3.png}
\caption[Average energy deposition in gamma profile detector simulated in GEANT4 as function of photon energy.]{Average energy deposition per photon in the gamma profile stack simulated in GEANT4 as a function of the incident photon energy in MeV. The grey dashed line at 15 MeV indicates roughly the separation between two regimes, in the first of which the energy deposition increases more per increase in incoming photon energy than in the second. The inset enlarges low photon energies up to 300 keV. The energy of the incoming photons is almost completely absorbed, i.e. $\epsilon_{dep} = \epsilon_X$ (black line), for 50 to 150 keV.}
\label{linICS:Figs:Edep_ResponseGEANT}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{linICS:Figs:Edep_ResponseGEANT} shows the simulated average energy deposited by one individual photon incident on the profile stack as a function of the photon energy, $\epsilon_\gamma$. The energy deposition increases steadily between $\epsilon_\gamma=1$ and $15\MeV$, before slowing down (grey dashed line) and increasing at a slower rate over the remaining simulated energy range. This behaviour is important as the corresponding electron energies coincide with this energy band. It has to be considered particularly when attempting to measure absolute quantities such as the total number of photons. The energy-dependency shown in Figure \ref{linICS:Figs:Edep_ResponseGEANT} contrasts the almost flat energy deposition of relativistic electron beams in Lanex \cite{Glinec2006_Lanex}.

\begin{figure}

The blue curve shows the spectrum as before. In the green curve, the y-value is weighted by the energy deposited per photon. Both curves have been normalised such that the peak value at 1200 MeV takes the value 1. The grey dashed line indicates the point at which the energy deposition per photon energy slows down (see Figure \ref{linICS:Figs:Edep_ResponseGEANT}).}
\label{linICS:Figs:Edep_Response}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{linICS:Figs:Edep_Response} shows an example electron spectrum and how different parts of the spectrum contribute in relative terms to the total energy deposition. 
The response of the detector is here dominated by the high energy peak, whilst the radiation from lower energy electrons is suppressed in relative terms. 
In this experiment, the response of a profile screen then mainly reflects the properties of the high-energy tail of the beam, in contrast to an electron beam profile diagnostic using a Lanex screen. 
In radiation reaction studies, the highest energies are of particular interest as they are expected to experience the strongest interaction and largest energy loss, such that this property might be of advantage in this scenario.
\vspace{\baselineskip}

Using the simulated result as a lookup-table for the energy deposition, $\epsilon_{dep}(\gamma)$, and relating the photon energy to the electron energy, the total energy deposition, $\mathcal{E}_{dep}$, can be calculated for a given electron spectrum, $\mathrm{d}N_e/\mathrm{d}\gamma$, as follows:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{\mathcal{E}_{dep} = \int \epsilon_{dep} (\gamma) \frac{\sigma_T}{\pi w^2_0} N_{ph} \frac{\mathrm{d}N_e}{\mathrm{d}\gamma}\mathrm{d}\gamma  \approx \langle \epsilon_{dep} (\gamma) \rangle N_X.}
\label{linICS:Eqs:Edep_YIELD}
\end{equation}
The energy-dependent response of the detector becomes in particular important when the electron and gamma spectrum cover a wide energy range, as is the case here. More energetic radiation contributes in relative terms more to the response of the profile.

The simulated response of the detector can also be used to calibrate the gamma profile screen with a radioactive source. Here, we used caesium-137 which emits gamma-rays predominantly at $661.7\,\mathrm{keV}$ photon energy \cite{Tanabashi2018_PDGReview}, for which the GEANT4 simulation estimates an energy deposition of $\sim 90\,\mathrm{keV}$ per photon. The response measured on the profile screen during the exposure with the radioactive source then gives a conversion factor from the total pixel counts on the CCD camera, $S_{\gamma}$, to energy deposition in $\mathrm{MeV}$, $\mathcal{E}_{dep,\gamma}$, i.e. an absolute energy calibration:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{E}_{dep, \gamma} = S_\gamma \times c_{S\rightarrow\mathcal{E}},
\end{equation}
where $c_{S\rightarrow\mathcal{E}}$ is in units of $[\mathrm{MeV}/\mathrm{pixel~counts}]$ and incorporates the conversion efficiency of energy to light and the collection efficiency of the detector setup. 

In turn, using Equation \eqref{linICS:Eqs:Edep_YIELD} in conjunction with this calibration, we can then determine the number of photons emitted on-shot, $N_{X,\gamma}$, by measuring the energy deposited in the gamma profile screen, $\mathcal{E}_{dep,\gamma}$, and the on-shot electron spectrum, $\mathrm{d}N_e/\mathrm{d}\gamma$. Since the energy deposition is proportional to the number of photons, we can compare the initial guess, $N_{X,0}$ (see Equation \eqref{Chap:linICS:Eqn:NX_UsefulUnits}), with the experimentally measured quantity, $N_{X,\gamma}$:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{N_{X,\gamma} \approx N_{X,0} \frac{\mathcal{E}_{dep,\gamma}}{\mathcal{E}_{dep,0}},}
\label{linICS:Eqn:NxGammaProfile}
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{E}_{dep,0}$ is the energy deposited by $N_{X,0}$ photons. $\mathcal{E}_{dep,0}$ and $\mathcal{E}_{dep,\gamma}$ rely on the same on-shot electron spectrum, beam charge, and its relation to the gamma spectrum and energy deposition. Within these assumptions, any difference in the estimated photon numbers is then related to errors in the absolute calibration, $c_{S\rightarrow\mathcal{E}}$, or the photon density $N_{ph}$. The first forms to some extent a systematic pre-factor that is constant on all shots, whilst the photon density is expected to fluctuate from shot to shot.

\end{figure}

We will now compare these quantities in the dataset discussed previously.
The analysed dataset consists of two parts, here simply referred to as \textsc{a} and \textsc{b}: \textsc{b} includes the laser raster scan presented in Section \ref{Chap:linICS:Sec:RasterScan} with an estimated average intensity of $a_0 \sim 0.28$ at a laser beam radius of $r = 200\pm50\,\mathrm{\upmu m}$. 
In dataset \textsc{a}, the beam size was not determined through the raster scan technique and the exact beam diameter is for now unknown, but based on the consistency of laser-electron interactions, we infer that the laser beam is again much larger than the electron bunch, i.e. $r \gg w_0$. 

Figure \ref{linICS:Figs:NxNxEXP_Plot} shows the number of photons estimated from the gamma profile measurement, $N_{X,\gamma}$, as a function of $N_{X,0}$ for \textsc{a} (blue) and \textsc{b} (purple), using the on-shot measurement of the laser energy and the on-shot spectrum of the electron beam.
The solid lines show the linear fits to the data of the respective dataset, the green line indicates where $N_{X,\gamma} = N_{X,0}$. The linear fit for \textsc{b} (purple) matches the green line closely, whereas $N_{X,\gamma}$ in \textsc{a} (blue) is systematically higher than $N_{X,0}$. In addition, the values in \textsc{a} are more scattered than in \textsc{b}, i.e. the shot-to-shot variations are stronger. 
This is also reflected in their linear correlation coefficients of $0.3$ and $0.5$, respectively. The systematic difference between \textsc{a} and \textsc{b} indicates different experimental conditions.

The histogram in Figure \ref{linICS:Figs:NxNxEXP_Plot_Histo} shows the ratio of $N_{X,\gamma}$ to the predicted value (green line), $N_{X,0}$, i.e. $N_{X,\gamma}/N_{X,0}$, following the same colour scheme as before.
The average ratio is $0.92\pm0.47$ for the data from the laser raster scan (\textsc{b}), where the error is the statistical error and not the measurement error of the technique. The mean value of $N_{X,\gamma}$ is within $<10\%$ in good agreement with $N_{X,0}$. The estimated number of photons for this part of the dataset was $(4.08\pm1.03)\times10^7$ photons, with $(3.65\pm2.1)\times10^7$ photons measured on the gamma profile screen. The ratio for \textsc{a} is higher at an average of $7.74\pm5.59$ with a large statistical variance, and single events even above a ratio of $10$. The estimated number of photons, $N_{X,0}$, was $2.75\pm1.06\times10^7$ photons compared to $1.93\pm1.49\times10^8$ photons measured on the gamma profile screen. The physical implications of this discrepancy are investigated in the following section.

%Assuming that the ratios in both datasets are affected by the same systematic factor, if at all, we find that the number of measured photons is $\sim8.6\pm5.7$ XXXX times larger in \textsc{a} than in \textsc{b}. As a result, even if we match $N_{X,0}$ and $N_{X,\gamma}$ for dataset \textsc{b} to account for a potential systematic error in the absolute calibration of the detector, there is a large discrepancy between $N_{X,0}$ and $N_{X,\gamma}$ in \textsc{a}, indicating different experimental conditions at the interaction than previously thought. Further implications of these ratios will be discussed in the following section.

\section{Estimate of laser beam size from photon yield}
\label{Chap:linICS:Sec:YieldBeamSize}

If we now consider the ratio of the energy depositions, $\mathcal{E}_{dep,\gamma}/\mathcal{E}_{dep,0}$, again and substitute for $N_{ph}$ from Equation \eqref{Chap:linICS:Eqn:Nph_subst}, we realise that the ratio is directly related to the beam radius of the laser pulse at the interaction plane:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\mathcal{E}_{dep,\gamma}}{\mathcal{E}_{dep,0}} = \frac{\int \epsilon_{dep} (\gamma) \frac{\sigma_T}{\pi w^2_{0,\gamma}} N_{ph,\gamma} \frac{\mathrm{d}N_e}{\mathrm{d}\gamma}\mathrm{d}\gamma}{\int \epsilon_{dep} (\gamma) \frac{\sigma_T}{\pi w^2_{0,0}} N_{ph,0} \frac{\mathrm{d}N_e}{\mathrm{d}\gamma}\mathrm{d}\gamma} = \frac{N_{ph,\gamma}/w^2_{0,\gamma}}{N_{ph,0}/w^2_{0,0}} = \frac{\epsilon_J/\left(\epsilon_{ph} r^2_\gamma\right)}{\epsilon_J/\left(\epsilon_{ph} r^2_0\right)} = \frac{r^2_0}{r^2_\gamma},
\end{equation}
where the subscripts $0$ and $\gamma$ for $N_{ph}, w_0, r$ and $\mathcal{E}_{dep}$ indicate again the quantities using either the initial estimate from the raster scan ($0$) or the yield on the gamma ($\gamma$) profile screen.
Most terms simply cancel out as we used the same on-shot electron spectrum, $\mathrm{d}N_e/\mathrm{d}\gamma$, and on-shot measurement of the laser energy, $\epsilon_J$, for both values of $\mathcal{E}_{dep}$.

Since the results in the previous section indicated that the absolute calibration of the gamma profile screen is accurate, we can use the ratio of the estimated scattered photons introduced in the previous section to infer the size of the scattering laser pulse at the interaction plane:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{r_\gamma = \sqrt{\frac{\mathcal{E}_{dep,0}}{\mathcal{E}_{dep,\gamma}}} r_{0} = \sqrt{\frac{N_{X,0}}{N_{X,\gamma}}} r_{0},}
\label{linICS:Eqn:rLaser_NxRatios}
\end{equation}
where $N_{X,0}$ is the number of scattered photons at radius $r_0$ estimated initially, and $N_{X,\gamma}$ is the number of photons inferred from the gamma profile measurement. The corresponding laser intensity in turn is then approximately
\begin{equation}
a_0 \approx 0.85 \lambda [\mu m] \sqrt{ I [10^{18} W/cm^2]} \approx 0.286 \times \sqrt{\epsilon [10 J]} (r [200 \mu m])^{-1},
\end{equation}
where we assumed a pulse duration $\tau = 45\,\mathrm{fs}$. This then reads in terms of the ratio of the estimated number of scattered photons
\begin{equation}
\boxed{a_0 \approx 0.286 \times \sqrt{\epsilon_J [10 J] \frac{N_{X,\gamma}}{N_{X,0}}}\frac{1}{r_0 [200 \mu m]}.}
\label{linICS:Eqn:a0Laser_NxRatios}
\end{equation}
The histograms in Figures \ref{linICS:Figs:NxNxEXP_radius} and \ref{linICS:Figs:NxNxEXP_a0} show the inferred beam radius and laser intensity at the interaction for the raster scan in dataset \textsc{b} (purple) and dataset \textsc{a} (blue) using the ratios from Figure \ref{linICS:Figs:NxNxEXP_Plot_Histo}.

\begin{figure}

Dataset \textsc{b} refers to the laser raster scan that was discussed in Section \ref{Chap:linICS:Sec:RasterScan}.}
\label{linICS:Figs:NxNxEXP_radius}
\end{figure}

In the previous section, we found good agreement between $N_{X,0}$ and $N_{X,\gamma}$ for dataset \textsc{b} (see Figure \ref{linICS:Figs:NxNxEXP_Plot_Histo}). Similarly, the corresponding estimates for the beam radius and intensity agree well within errors at $r = 230 \pm 63\,\mathrm{\upmu m}$ and $a_0 = 0.28 \pm 0.07$  with $r = 200\pm50\,\mathrm{\upmu m}$ and $a_0 = 0.28 \pm 0.04$ estimated by the raster scan.

We can now estimate the relative beam diameter in the dataset \textsc{a} that was not evaluated with the raster scan.
The inferred number of photons in dataset \textsc{a} is systematically higher than in \textsc{b}, which indicates that the beam size is here consistently smaller by a factor $\sim \sqrt{7.74} \approx 2.78$. Equation \eqref{linICS:Eqn:rLaser_NxRatios} suggests a radius of $r \approx 75\pm 32\,\mathrm{\upmu m}$ which corresponds to an average intensity of $a_0 \approx 0.74\pm0.26$ (see Figure \ref{linICS:Figs:NxNxEXP_a0}), where the error bars are the statistical error assuming a normal distribution. 
The values at the higher end reach or surpass $a_0 \sim 1$, where nonlinear affects like higher harmonics and redshifting become significant (see Section \ref{Theory:Sec:NonlinearICS} and \cite{Esarey1993_NT}). In this weakly nonlinear regime, our assumptions regarding the spectral shape of the gamma emission break down and the estimate of the beam size based on the deposited energy becomes less reliable, although it can be used to identify the onset of more intense interactions.
Other work demonstrated that the production of higher harmonic radiation and their relative contribution to the spectrum can be used to estimate the intensity in the weakly nonlinear regime \cite{Kramer2018_Gamma}, but a highly resolved spectral measurement is more challenging in the $\mathrm{MeV}$ photon energy range.

\label{linICS:Figs:NxNxEXP_a0}
\end{figure}

This technique seems to be a promising single-shot diagnostic to estimate the laser intensity and beam diameter at the interaction point at lower intensities $a_0 < 1$, and will become particularly useful in combination with the laser raster scan presented in Section \ref{Chap:linICS:Sec:RasterScan} applied to radiation reaction studies. 
Here in both datasets either the beam position (raster scan) or the relative delay was varied, with the second dataset being close to the onset of weakly nonlinear effects where some of the assumptions break down. 
In a future measurement at fixed conditions and strictly low intensities $a_0 < 1$, the varying deviation from a reference photon number, $N_{X,0}$ could be used to diagnose the fluctuations in the relative arrival time of the electron beam and the laser pulse. Combined with an on-shot measurement of the relative fluctuations in the delay of both laser pulses, for instance using spectral interferometry \cite{Corvan2016_TIMING}, this could distinguish variations in the arrival time of the electron beam due to fluctuations in the relative delay of the laser pulses or due to changes in the injection point. Moreover, this technique could be refined by corroborating the absolute calibration of the gamma profile screen with a second radioactive source or different calibration method.

\section{Spectral Retrieval}
\label{linICS:Chap:Sec:SpectralRetrieval}

In the previous sections, we established the experimental conditions at the interaction, and identified how the electron spectra and the emitted radiation are related to each other (Section \ref{Chap:linICS:Sec:GammaSpec_A}). 
In this section, we will confirm whether this relation holds in the experiment by retrieving the gamma spectrum for specific examples. 
Due to time constraints, we will not make use of the full capabilities of the detector and neglect alternating crystal rows (see Section \ref{Chap:Methods:subsec:GammaSpec}). 
We will use the electron beam measured on-shot to estimate the gamma spectrum and fit the simulated response for this spectrum to the experimentally measured detector response \cite{Behm2018_Gamma}. 
Since the detector response will be dominated by the part of the electron spectrum containing the most charge, we will also fit the simulated response to the average electron energy.
%The spectrometer setup (`dual axis' spectrometer) and the retrieval method are discussed in detail in Section \ref{Chap:Methods:subsec:GammaSpec}.
\vspace{\baselineskip}

Figure \ref{Chap:linICS:Fig:SpectralFits} shows three examples of electron spectra (centre) along with the gamma profile (left) and the gamma spectrometer response (right) measured on the same shot. 
The top two rows were taken from dataset \textsc{b}, the laser raster scan, and the example on the bottom is part of dataset \textsc{a}, which was estimated to include interactions at systematically higher intensities. 
The experimentally measured response of the gamma spectrometer, treated for bremsstrahlung background and varying crystal efficiencies etc. (see Section \ref{Chap:Methods:subsec:GammaSpec}), is shown in blue as a function of the longitudinal crystal row (higher numbers are deeper in the stack). 
The yellow curve shows the simulated response to a monoenergetic spectrum fitting best to the experimental data, determined by a least square regression where the photon energy and amplitude were varied. The red curve shows the simulated response to the ICS gamma spectrum calculated from the electron beam measured on-shot.

The experimental and both simulated responses agree very well with each other in all three cases. 
Smaller deviations are within errors, e.g. increased yield in the experimental response for the second example (centre), and we need to analyse more gamma spectra to identify systematic differences.
The inferred gamma energies are consistent with linear inverse Compton scattering and the assumptions we made about the conditions at the interaction.
However, the fact that the simulated response to monoenergetic gamma rays and the ICS spectra are so similar indicates that this detector is not able to resolve the shape of the spectrum but predominantly reflects its average energy. 
That makes sense as the response of the detector to the photons is in most parts not spectrally separated, e.g. as in an electron spectrometer. 
As a consequence, we can not \textit{infer} the spectral shape from the response itself, but have to \textit{assume} a spectral shape based on the experimental conditions and can only use this detector to determine its characteristic energy, e.g. a critical energy in a synchrotron spectrum or here the mean energy. 
The photon energies of the best fitting responses were (from top to bottom) $15.5\MeV$, $11.4\MeV$ and $12.5\MeV$, with average gamma energies calculated from the electron spectra of $15.9\MeV$, $11\MeV$ and $12.1\MeV$, respectively, which shows a good agreement between the results.
\vspace{\baselineskip}

Future measurements of gamma radiation would greatly benefit from an increased sensitivity of the spectral retrieval, in particular to be able to infer the spectrum without imposing an assumed spectral shape. One proposed diagnostic that could achieve this in the future combines a scintillator stack as used here with a Compton or pair spectrometer \cite{Corvan2014_Gamma,Lisi2018_Gamma,Abramowicz2019_LUXE} (see also Section \ref{Concl:Sec:ExpCons:Radiation}). This would be, for instance, interesting for a detailed study of inverse Compton scattering at comparable intensities as the data presented here. The spectral shape is particularly sensitive to nonlinear effects in this intermediate regime between a purely linear and nonlinear treatment. As a consequence, this would be a useful tool to infer the intensity at the interaction to a high accuracy \cite{Babzien2006_ICS_2ndHarmonic}. At very high intensities, on the other hand, it would allow to distinguish a classical synchrotron spectrum from the quantum synchrotron function (see Appendix \ref{Appendix:Sec:QuantumSynchrotron}) and identify potential signs of stochastic quantum effects like energy straggling \cite{Shen1972_STRAGGLING}, which is of interest for radiation reaction studies \cite{Blackburn2019_RRReview} (see Section \ref{Theory:Sec:RR:QRR}).

\subsubsection{Nonlinearity}
\EliasComm{This needs to be re-written once I have more results on this.}
\EliasComm{Try to find systematic offset and then see whether the small change in the r015 data is weakly nonlinear.}
\SMComm{Maybe remove nonlinearity and just explain this could be why.}
In this scenario the interaction is clearly linear and we expect that variations of the emitted gamma radiation due to high-intensity effects such as higher harmonic generation and redshifting to be negligible. Later in Chapter \ref{Chap:RR15} we will consider the highly non-linear case where the emitted spectrum blends together to a broadband synchrotron-like emission spectrum. The intermediate region between the two limits of purely linear and highly non-linear is interesting and could be used to put a bound on the intensity at the interaction based on the emission spectrum.

\centering
\includegraphics[width=1.0\columnwidth]{PlaceHolder_perturbedResponse.png}
\caption{This is to indicate change in response.}
\label{linICS:Figs:GammaSpec_PerturbationNonlinear}
\end{figure}


For this purpose, we will now perturb the emission spectrum with a second harmonic as we would first expect to see at intensities approaching $a_0 = 1$. The change in response will give us an idea what the signature of the additional emission component would be and how strong the component would have to be to be measurable in this setting. 
An example is shown in Figure \ref{linICS:Figs:GammaSpec_PerturbationNonlinear}: on the left the calculated response of the detector to the fundamental emission of the electron spectrum. The response is well reproduced by a mono-energetic photon source of energy 10.16 MeV. On the right-hand side now the mono-energetic spectrum (yellow), a response curve combining the first and second harmonic at 1:0.9 ratio and the response for the second harmonic source only (blue). The change in energy leads to a steepening of the energy deposition curve from the first to the second crystal and a slightly slower decay over the following crystals before decaying very similarly beyond the fourth crystal or so. The change in response for the combined response is only visible due to the strong second harmonic component. However, at $a_0 \sim 0.3$ a 90 percent contribution of the second harmonic source is unrealistic, whereas $< 10\%$ are not visible as the mean energy remains similar.
Comparing these decay curves with the examples provided earlier we do not see a steep increase in energy deposition relative to the fundamental response which indicates that the second harmonic contribution is zero or negligible. 
A more sensitive detector setup could be used to measure small changes to more accuracy to measure the change in intensity.

\section{Compton scattering as electron beam diagnostic}
\label{Chap:linICS:Sec:ICS_EbeamDiag}

Linear Compton scattering of an electron beam and a laser pulse is at these low intensities non-invasive and well understood, which signals its potential as diagnostic. Moreover, we have shown that the electron bunch and the laser beam can be overlapped over extended periods of time due to the large size of the laser beam. In the previous sections, we have already demonstrated that linear ICS can be used to diagnose the size of the laser pulse and its intensity at the interaction. We will now discuss its potential to diagnose the electron beam instead.

Linear ICS has already been used as beam diagnostics \cite{Kramer2018_Gamma} to determine the energy \cite{Utsunomiya2014_ICS_BeamEnergy}, beam size \cite{Sakai2001_BeamSize}, emittance \cite{Golovin2016_ICS_BeamEmittance}, transverse and longitudinal charge distribution \cite{Leemans1996_ICS_BeamTransLong} or polarisation \cite{Barber1993_POL,Baylac2002_POL,Weber2018_POL} of electron beams at conventional and plasma-based accelerators. 
However, it is typically used as a \textit{multi-shot} diagnostics that involves scans in order to determine the properties of the electron beam, similar to the laser raster scan we presented earlier in Section \ref{Chap:linICS:Sec:RasterScan}. 
In these setups, the laser has to be focused tightly to produce a measurable yield of gamma-rays such that the focus is typically smaller than the transverse size of the electron bunch at that plane.
Here, we propose to use the emission from linear ICS in conjunction with the gamma profile screen as \textit{single-shot} beam profile measurement.
Similarly to a physical beam profile monitor, as used frequently on laser wakefield experiments, this would be used to measure the beam pointing and the divergence of the electron beam (see for instance \cite{Downer2018_DiagnosticReview}). 

A physical beam profile screen is in the context of radiation reaction studies not ideal as it would produce bremsstrahlung on-axis, which would make the spectral retrieval of the ICS spectrum more challenging (see Section \ref{Chap:Methods:subsec:GammaSpec}). 
Such a profile screen, e.g. Lanex, would also require a static laser beam dump to terminate the wakefield driver beam or a plasma mirror as protection, both of which would result in the emission of bremsstrahlung and increasing complexity of the setup. 
A laser beam dump and the beam profile monitor  would also lead to small-angle scattering of the electron beam, affecting the spectral measurement further downstream. 
In LWFA setups, the electron beam is typically spectrally dispersed close to the accelerator to reduce uncertainties in the inferred energy measurement resulting from beam pointing and divergence. 
As a consequence, any beam profile measurement of the non-dispersed beam has to be conducted close to the accelerator (or the magnet has to be retractable/tunable). 
The short distance limits the spatial resolution. In addition, any scattering of the beam will propagate long distances, reducing the beam quality and a subsequent measurement of the beam energy. 
An early non-invasive measurement would benefit from a potentially improved spatial resolution as it can in principle be propagated indefinitely to increase the spatial resolution via geometric magnification. 
Moreover, wakefield accelerators often produce a large number of electrons at few MeV energy that are typically not resolved by magnetic spectrometers but will dominate the response of the beam profile screen \cite{Glinec2006_Lanex}.

The magnetic electron spectrometer in this experiment measures the beam pointing and divergence in the non-dispersion direction. 
In general, we expect that the electron beam and its divergence show some extent of cylindrical symmetry as the accelerating cavity (the `bubble') will. 
Asymmetric injection and beam oscillations can, however produce elliptical beams.
Any beam pointing in the dispersion axis affects the accuracy of the energy inferred from the spectrometer setup.
Two-screen setups have been used previously in LWFA experiments to infer the beam pointing \cite{Clayton2010_ION,Soloviev2011_TWOSCREEN} and were also used in this experiment. 
However, two-screen setups require a finite drift space between the screens to reach a sufficient resolution and contrast (if spatial references are used), whilst scattering induced from vacuum windows and Lanex screens will counteract the beneficial effect of the drift, limiting the resolution of the measurable beam pointing intrinsically.

Linear ICS promises to measure the beam pointing and divergence without impacting any further measurement of the beam properties and its transport. 
It seems in particular of interest as tool to characterise the fluctuations of the electron beam en route to high-intensity interactions for radiation reaction studies. 
In the highly non-linear regime, the interaction becomes invasive due to energy loss in the electron beam \cite{Thomas2012_LL}, but here the deformation of the emitted radiation cone in turn gives additional information about the intensity at the interaction point \cite{HarShemesh2012_INTENSITY,Yan2017_ICS,Blackburn2019_ModelIndependentLaser}, simply using the same setup.
We will in the following explore the feasibility of this diagnostic.

\caption[Montage of electron spectra and corresponding gamma profile measurements.]{Montage of electron spectra and corresponding gamma profile measurements (on their right side) for a selection of shots. The axes for the gamma profile screens show the horizontal (x-axis) and vertical (y-axis) divergence. The axes for the electron spectrometer images are the vertical divergence (y-axis) and the electron energy (x-axis). The colour scale is proportional to the energy deposited in the gamma profile screen per $mrad^2$, and to the charge of the electron beam per $mrad \times MeV$. The lineouts on the x- and y-axes are the 2D images projected onto that respective axis. The maximum height of the lineouts changes for each image. Note that electron and gamma pointing deviate from each other in some instances (see Section \ref{Chap:linICS:Sec:ICS_EbeamDiag:Subsec:Pointing}).}
\label{linICS:Figs:LaserWireExamples_Montage}
\end{figure}

This section investigates the relation of the measured gamma profile and the spatial structure of the electron beams. For this purpose, we will compare the measurements of the electron spectrometer with the corresponding gamma profile screen measurements at the example of particularly structured electron bunches.
\vspace{\baselineskip}

Figure \ref{linICS:Figs:LaserWireExamples_Montage} shows a montage of electron beams measured in the dataset along with the corresponding gamma beam profile measured on the profile screen (on the left of the respective electron spectrometer image). Similarly as the electron beam varies strongly from shot to shot the gamma profile also changes shape, reflecting distinct features in the electron beam. 
The example on the top left of the Figure, for instance, shows an electron beam with distinct oscillations in the vertical axis. This is accompanied by an elongated gamma profile measurement, which indicates that the oscillations are predominantly in the vertical direction and that the elongation of the beam is less pronounced in the dispersion direction.
The example on the top right shows an electron beam that is tilted in the vertical direction. The gamma beam also indicates a vertical offset, but also shows that the tilt is not only in the vertical but also in the horizontal axis.

Figure \ref{linICS:Figs:LaserWireExamples_Ring} shows a highly divergent electron beam around 450 MeV energy. 
On the electron spectrometer image, the electrons are mainly seen concentrated in one point with a straight line in the vertical direction. 
The gamma profile screen, on the other hand, reveals a highly divergent ring-like radiation pattern with a beamlet in the centre, which is not evident from the spectrometer screen.

The corresponding gamma-ray beam measured with the profile (left) shows that the beams are not only separated vertically but also in the horizontal axis. More examples are shown in Figures \ref{linICS:Figs:LaserWireExamples_IntensityMatch_Mono}, \ref{linICS:Figs:LaserWireExamples_IntensityMatch_Tilt} and \ref{linICS:Figs:LaserWireExamples_IntensityMatch_Wing}.

These examples show that the measured radiation profiles are capable of reproducing spatial features visible in the electron spectra and but are also able to provide an additional insight into the composition of the electron beam that is hidden in the dispersion direction of the electron beam.

In addition to this qualitative insight, we want to investigate how well the radiation profile measured on the gamma profile screen reflects the spatial features of the electron spectra in terms of their spatial scale and relative signal strength. 
Figures \ref{linICS:Figs:LaserWireExamples_Beamlets}, \ref{linICS:Figs:LaserWireExamples_IntensityMatch_Mono}, \ref{linICS:Figs:LaserWireExamples_IntensityMatch_Tilt} and \ref{linICS:Figs:LaserWireExamples_IntensityMatch_Wing} show four examples, where this time the gamma profile measurement and the electron spectrum are complemented by a third panel that compares the projections onto the $y$-axis of both the gamma profile and electron spectra. 
The first observation is that the gamma-ray measurements consistently show broader profiles as the electron measurements (see for instance Fig. \ref{linICS:Figs:LaserWireExamples_Beamlets}). This is expected as the emitted radiation has a larger divergence than the electron beam.

Figure \ref{linICS:Figs:LaserWireExamples_Beamlets} shows two vertically separated beamlets of similar charge. 
The spatial separation agrees well on both integrated signals (bottom), on the electron spectrometer screen (blue) and the gamma profile (yellow). 
The relative height of both peaks is also well reproduced by the gamma measurement (yellow). 
Since the energy deposited by photons produced at electron energies between $1-1.2\GeV$ does not change much, the related radiation profile is also not expected to be altered significantly (red curve).

Figure \ref{linICS:Figs:LaserWireExamples_IntensityMatch_Mono} shows a narrow-energy spread beam of $\sim1.2\GeV$ central electron energy. The main beam is accompanied by two lower charge beamlets on either vertical side at $\sim-1.2$ and $\sim2.5\mrad$ on the vertical axis of the spectrometer screen. The integrated gamma profile signal (yellow) shows a secondary peak at a comparable distance to the main peak as the spectrometer lineout (blue). The radiation related to the second beamlet is not measured and might be outside of the field of view of the detector. The amplitude of the gamma signal for the beamlet is much larger than the relative charge on the spectrometer screen. Its amplitude, however, matches the other `missing' beamlet. 

Considering Figure \ref{linICS:Figs:LaserWireExamples_IntensityMatch_Wing}, we see now more clearly that the vertical profile on the electron spectrometer screen (blue) and the gamma profile (yellow) are seemingly inverted relative to each other (purple). The electron beam has a secondary beamlet offset by about $\sim -3.2\mrad$ from the main beam (dashed line), whereas the gamma profile shows a secondary peak on the other side at $\sim + 1.8 \mrad$.

The interaction of the laser pulse and the electron beam occurred in the plasma which could be related to the discrepancy of the gamma profile and the electron beam. 
This could be related to betatron oscillations or the evolution of the accelerating cavity (`bubble') through changes in the plasma density. 
The data is, however, too ambiguous and sparse to provide conclusive evidence.
%Section \ref{Chap:linICS:Sec:InversionHypothesis} will explore different hypotheses to find an explanation.
Despite some discrepancy on some of these examples, this section showed that the gamma profile reproduces features in the electron beam, including their relative signal strength and spatial separation. We have also seen that the profile measurement can give further insight into the spatial arrangement of the electron beam that are not visible on the spectrometer screen.

\subsection{Beam Pointing}
\label{Chap:linICS:Sec:ICS_EbeamDiag:Subsec:Pointing}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[trim={4.8cm 0 5cm 0}, clip, width=0.9\columnwidth]{linICS_Espec_GP_Pointing_V2.png}
\caption[Vertical beam pointing of the gamma beam and the electron beam.]{Vertical beam pointing (position of the beam centroid) in mrad measured on the gamma profile screen as function of the relative beam pointing of the electron beam. The observables do not show any significant correlation at a correlation coefficient of -0.15.}
\label{linICS:Figs:Pointing}
\end{figure}

In ICS, the photons are backscattered in the propagation direction of the electron beam, due to the Lorentz boost of the electron beam. As a result, the photon distribution is a reflection of the momentum vector of the electrons. 
Figure \ref{linICS:Figs:Pointing} shows the vertical pointing of the gamma ray beam, in terms of the relative deviation from a reference point on a screen, as a function of the vertical pointing of the electron bunch measured with the electron spectrometer. Surprisingly, both quantities do not seem to be correlated significantly at a linear correlation coefficient of $-0.15$.
Since the interaction with the laser pulse occurs in the plasma, it could be suspected that the electron beam pointing is still changing throughout its remaining propagation in the plasma, such that the pointing variations of the gamma radiation do not correlate well with the final beam properties. 
This aligns with the discrepancies in the signals discussed previously. 
Consequently, the interaction should take place outside of the plasma, i.e. in vacuum, where the momentum distribution of the electron bunch is fixed to render this a useful on-shot pointing diagnostic.

\subsection{Divergence and Ellipticity}

The profile screen measures the size of the radiation cone at the plane of the detector, $\sigma_D$. Using the small-angle approximation, it is given by:
\begin{equation}
\sigma_D \approx \theta_f d + \sigma_S \approx \theta_f d,
\end{equation}
where $d$ is the distance from the source to the detector plane, $\sigma_S$ is the source size and $\theta_f$ is the divergence of the emission cone. The contribution of the source size, $\sigma_S$, is negligible, i.e. $\theta_f d \gg \sigma_S$, since $d \sim \mathrm{m}$ and $\theta \sim \mathrm{mrad}$ but $\sigma_S \sim \mathrm{\upmu m}$. As a consequence, the profile screen measures effectively the divergence of the radiation cone, $\theta_f$.

The divergence of the full gamma ray beam, $\theta_f$, incorporates the divergence of the electron bunch, $\theta_e$, and the gamma emission cones around each individual electron, $\theta_\gamma$:
\begin{align}
\theta_f &= \sqrt{\theta^2_e + \theta^2_\gamma},\label{linICS:Eqn:DivergenceTheta_f}\\
\Rightarrow \theta_\gamma &= \sqrt{\theta^2_f - \theta^2_e}, \label{linICS:Eqn:DivergenceTheta_gamma}
\end{align}
where the $\theta_\gamma \sim 1/\gamma$, i.e. radiation from linear ICS is emitted in a narrow cone of divergence $\sim 1/\gamma$. $\gamma$ is the relativistic Lorentz factor of the electrons. 
Within an electron beam, the divergence, $\theta_e$, and charge distribution might vary with electron energy, which we will ignore for now and instead consider the profile of the full electron beam integrated over all energies.
We also assume that the laser pulse interacts with the entire electron bunch.
If $\theta_\gamma \ll \theta_e$, then the divergence of the total emitted radiation cone, $\theta_f$, is simply the sum of both, i.e. $\theta_f \approx \theta_e + \theta_\gamma$.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[trim={3cm 0 5cm 0}, clip, width=0.5\columnwidth]{linICS_FWHM_Y_Espec_GP_V6.png}\includegraphics[trim={3cm 0 5cm 0}, clip, width=0.5\columnwidth]{linICS_FWHM_XY_V2.png}
\caption[\textsc{fwhm} divergences of the gamma profile and electron beam.]{\textsc{fwhm} divergences of the gamma profile and electron beam.

Right: Vertical divergence, $\theta_y$, as a function of horizontal divergence, $\theta_x$, for the full gamma profile, $\theta_f$ (purple), the contribution of the gamma emission cone, $\theta_\gamma$ (yellow, using Equation \eqref{linICS:Eqn:DivergenceTheta_gamma}), and the electron divergence, $\theta_e$ (blue). The dashed line indicates $\theta_{y} = \theta_{x}$.}
\label{linICS:Figs:ICS_Espec_Divergence}
\end{figure}

In the experiment, the electron beam is dispersed in the horizontal axis, here $x$, to measure its energy, which destroys its spatial component in $x$. The vertical axis on the electron spectrometer, $y$, is preserved and can be used to measure the divergence of the beam, $\theta_{e,y}$. 
If we assume cylindrical symmetry for the electron beam, the divergence in the horizontal axis is simply identical, i.e. $\theta_{e,x} = \theta_{e,y}=\theta_e$.
On the other hand, we can instead assume that the contribution of $\theta_\gamma$ is constant in both axes, i.e. $\theta_\gamma = \theta_{\gamma,x} = \theta_{\gamma,y}$, which holds for $a_0 \ll 1$. 
We can then use the divergences measured on the profile screen, $\theta_{f,x}$ and $\theta_{f,y}$, and the divergence of the electron beam measured on the electron spectrometer, $\theta_{e,y}$, to infer the divergence of the electron beam in the horizontal axis, $\theta_{e,x}$:
\begin{align}
\theta_{e,x} &= \sqrt{\theta^2_{f,x} - \theta^2_\gamma}\\ \nonumber
 &=\sqrt{ \theta^2_{f,x} - [\theta^2_{f,y} - \theta^2_{e,y}]},
\end{align}
where we only obtain a real value for $\theta_{f,x} \geq \theta_\gamma$ and similarly $\theta_{f,y} \geq \theta_{e,y}$ for $\theta_\gamma$. 
Figure \ref{linICS:Figs:ICS_Espec_Divergence} (left) shows that the condition $\theta_{f,y} \geq \theta_{e,y}$ holds for most of the dataset, except for one outlier. 
The condition $\theta_{f,x} \geq \theta_\gamma$, however, does not hold for a significant number in the dataset for which we can not calculate $\theta_{e,x}$. 
This means that the relation between the measured quantities is not suitable in these or maybe all instances. 
This could either be due to integrating over the entire spectrum, missing a large amount of electrons below the low-energy cut-off of the electron spectrometer, or a change in the electron beam properties after the interaction as indicated in the previous sections. 

Figure \ref{linICS:Figs:ICS_Espec_Divergence} (right) shows the measured and calculated divergences in the $x-y$ plane, where only divergences with real values are shown. 
The values for the full divergence, $\theta_f$ (purple), are mostly larger than the electron divergences, $\theta_e$ (blue), as expected by this selection. 
The scatter around the dotted axis indicates non-symmetric beams, i.e. for which $\theta_x \neq \theta_y$. The average electron divergences are $\langle \theta_{e,y} \rangle = 2.14 \pm 0.65\mrad$ (measured) and $\langle \theta_{e,x} \rangle = 2.52 \pm 1.13\mrad$ (inferred). 
The values for $\theta_\gamma$ (yellow), calculated using Equation \eqref{linICS:Eqn:DivergenceTheta_gamma}, lie on the dashed line where $\theta_x = \theta_y$ as we assumed symmetry. 
$\theta_\gamma$ varies strongly from shot to shot from $\theta_\gamma < 1\mrad$ to $>6\mrad$, which is either related to the strong fluctuations in the electron spectrum or it simply absorbs the potential change in the electron divergence after the interaction, i.e. does not represent the actual value of $\theta_\gamma$.
The discrepancies in some parts of this dataset should be investigated in a future measurement.

The dashed grey line indicates $f = 1$, i.e. a symmetric beam.}
\label{linICS:Figs:EllipticityGamma}
\end{figure}


Nonetheless, using the part of the dataset where we were able to calculate all divergences, we can now determine the ellipticity for both, the electron beam and the gamma beam.
The ratio of these divergences is called the ellipticity:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{empheq}[box=\widefbox]{align}
f_\gamma &= \frac{\theta_{f,\parallel}}{\theta_{f,\perp}} = \sqrt{\frac{\theta^2_{e,\parallel}+\theta^2_\gamma}{\theta^2_{e,\perp}+\theta^2_\gamma}},\\
f_e &= \frac{\theta_{e,\parallel}}{\theta_{e,\perp}} = \frac{\theta_{e,\parallel}}{\sqrt{\theta^2_{e,\parallel} + \theta^2_{f,\perp} - \theta^2_{f,\parallel}}},
\end{empheq}
\label{Chap:linICS:Eqns:Ellipticity}
\end{subequations}
where $f_\gamma$ is the ellipticity of the total radiation cone that can be measured directly and $f_e$ is the ellipticity of the electron beam that is inferred. 
A value of unity indicates that the beam is symmetric. 
If $\theta_\gamma \ll \theta_e$, then $f_\gamma \approx f_e$, and we can obtain the ellipticity of the electron beam directly from the gamma profile measurement. 
The results shown in Figure \ref{linICS:Figs:ICS_Espec_Divergence} suggest that this might not always be the case, but this has to be investigated in more detail. 
Figure \ref{linICS:Figs:EllipticityGamma} shows the ellipticities of the full gamma-ray beam (using only measured quantities), $f_f$ (purple), and the inferred values for the electron beam, $f_e$ (blue). 
The median value for the gamma-ray beam is $0.97(+0.22/\!-0.11)$ which indicates on average symmetry. 
The deviations reach up to 0.5 and 2, which correspond to an elliptical beam where the long axis is twice the size of the short axis. 
The electron beam, on the other hand, has a median value of $0.81(+0.2/\!-0.12)$ which indicates a slight asymmetry of the beam on average.  
However, considering the inconsistencies in some parts of the dataset, the values might not be reliable for all shots.
It would be desirable to repeat these measurements in vacuum instead of plasma to confirm that this removes these inconsistencies and improves other correlations, e.g. for beam pointing.
\vspace{\baselineskip}

The profile of the emitted radiation is of great interest for radiation reaction studies as it indicates the intensity of the laser pulse at the interaction \cite{HarShemesh2012_INTENSITY,Yan2017_ICS}. 
The ellipticity, in particular, permits a model-independent inference of the intensity \cite{Blackburn2019_ModelIndependentLaser}. 
There $a_0 \gg 1$, such that we are in the nonlinear regime of Thomson or Compton scattering and the symmetry of the emission cone is broken, i.e. $\theta_{\gamma,\parallel} \neq \theta_{\gamma,\perp}$.
The fluctuating ellipticity of the e-beam motivates similar statistical measurements as part of radiation reaction studies that use this inference method and to estimate the error associated with these fluctuations. 
For this purpose, it is paramount to refine the methods outlined here and investigate discrepancies systematically.
An independent measurement of the electron beam ellipticity, on the other hand, would remove this error on a shot-to-shot basis and allow to use the absolute divergence of the radiation profile to probe different models of radiation reaction.

\iffalse


In a first step, to confirm the measurements are sensible, we will compare the vertical divergence of the gamma beam and the electron bunch measured with the gamma profile screen and with the electron spectrometer, for which the vertical axis is the non-dispersion axis. Figure \ref{linICS:Figs:ICS_Espec_Divergence} shows the \textsc{fwhm} divergence measured with the gamma profile screen as function of the divergence measured on the electron spectrometer screen on the same shot. Both measurements are linearly correlated at a correlation coefficient of $0.63$. Ignoring for now the variation in the offset expected due to the shot-to-shot variation in energies, a linear function is fitted to the data. 

The slope of the fitted line is $1.03 \sim 1$, which is consistent with the relation proposed in Equation \eqref{linICS:Eqn:DivergenceTheta_f}. The scattering around the fitted line could then be related to shot-to-shot fluctuations in the electron energy, the limited spatial resolution and other measurement errors. The deviation of the on-shot data from the line fit is shown in Figure \ref{linICS:Figs:ICS_Espec_Divergence} (right side). Assuming a normal distribution of the scatter the standard deviation is $0.81\,\mathrm{mrad}$.
A change in energy from 200 MeV to 1300 MeV varies the contribution of the term $1/\gamma$ from $2.56$ to $0.39\,\mathrm{mrad}$, and we have seen that not only the maximum energy but the charge distribution varies significantly from shot-to-shot. 
The $y$-axis offset for the fitted slope is $1.4\,\mathrm{mrad}$, which corresponds to an energy of $365\,\mathrm{MeV}$. The standard deviation around this value then corresponds to a wide energy range of $230\MeV$ to $866\MeV$, which is consistent with the spectra characterised in Section \ref{Chap:linICS:sec:Espec}.

\label{linICS:Figs:EllipticityGamma}
\end{figure}

We will for simplicity assume one fixed offset to infer the divergence of the electron beam in the dispersion axis from the gamma profile measurement by using
\begin{equation}
\theta_e = \theta_f - C,
\label{linICS:Eqs:Divergence_Electron_Fit}
\end{equation}
where $C$ is the $y$-axis offset fitted to the data. This yields a horizontal divergence of $2.2 \pm 1.4\,\mathrm{mrad}$ compared to $2.2 \pm 0.6\,\mathrm{mrad}$ in the vertical axis, where the error is the statistical error in the dataset. This indicates that the electron beam is on average symmetric in terms of divergence (ellipticity $\sim 1$) and that measuring the divergence in the non-dispersion axis is sufficient to estimate the average error on the inferred electron energy. However, there are examples of non-unity ellipticity that could then lead to an over- or underestimate of the inferred energy. The ellipticity of the gamma-ray profile, $f_\gamma$, is calculated by dividing the divergences of the two axes, $\theta_{f,\parallel}$ and $\theta_{f,\perp}$, whereas the ellipticity of the electron beam, $f_e$ requires applying Equation \eqref{linICS:Eqs:Divergence_Electron_Fit} first:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{empheq}[box=\widefbox]{align}
f_\gamma &= \frac{\theta_{f,\parallel}}{\theta_{f,\perp}} = \frac{\theta_{e,\parallel}+\theta_\gamma}{\theta_{e,\perp}+\theta_\gamma},\\
f_e &= \frac{\theta_{e,\parallel}}{\theta_{e,\perp}} = \frac{\theta_{f,\parallel}-C}{\theta_{f,\perp}-C},
\end{empheq}
\label{Chap:linICS:Eqns:Ellipticity}
\end{subequations}
where we assume that the contribution by the gamma emission itself, $\theta_\gamma$, is constant and identical in both axes. Figure \ref{linICS:Figs:EllipticityGamma} shows the measured ellipticity of the gamma-ray beam and the inferred electron beam. The average ellipticity of the gamma profile has $1.03\pm0.16$ and inferred ellipticity of the electron beam is $(1.06-0.38/+0.32)$, where the errors are the lower and upper quartile, respectively. The average value of $\sim 1$ indicates that both are on average symmetric in both axes.




\subsection{Inversion of the electron and gamma signal}
\label{Chap:linICS:Sec:InversionHypothesis}

In the previous sections, we demonstrated that the gamma-ray emission measured on the gamma profile screen resolves distinct spatial features of the electron beam that are also visible on the electron spectrometer screen, and can be used to infer the divergence and ellipticity of both the gamma-ray beam and the electron bunch. 
However, there seems to be a consistent `inversion' of the vertical position of the gamma signal and the at least visibly associated spatial charge distribution in the electron spectra, i.e. high and low charge features correspond to lower and higher yield on the gamma profile screen, respectively. This is, for instance, visible in Figure \ref{linICS:Figs:LaserWireExamples_IntensityMatch_Tilt} and \ref{linICS:Figs:LaserWireExamples_IntensityMatch_Wing}. The relative orientation of the signals on both detectors has been confirmed independently by a camera imaging both screens simultaneously.
\vspace{\baselineskip}

We will discuss three potential explanations for this: first, the apparent inversion of the signal is caused by a variation in laser intensity. Second, the spatial distribution of the beam interacting with the laser pulse and its final properties are inverted, for instance due to betatron oscillations, so that the gamma signal is representative of the spatial beam properties at the interaction which then change. Lastly, the emission is representative of the momentum distribution of the electron beam. Here the electrons are consistently in a focusing phase at the interaction, such that the emitted gamma-rays are producing an inverted signal.
\vspace{\baselineskip}

Taking into account the number of photons produced from Equation \eqref{Chap:linICS:Eqn:NX_UsefulUnits}, we require a variation of intensity or photon density across the electron bunch to reproduce an emission profile as in Figure \ref{linICS:Figs:LaserWireExamples_IntensityMatch_Tilt}, if we assume that the electron charge distribution measured by the electron spectrometer is accurate. Alternatively, a large difference in the electron energy can result in a change in the  relative energy deposition in the profile screen. In Figure \ref{linICS:Figs:LaserWireExamples_IntensityMatch_Tilt}, for instance, the bright spot could be related to the increase in energy. However, the change in energy deposition is much more subtle than the change in the charge distribution (see Figure \ref{linICS:Figs:Edep_ResponseGEANT}). Considering a change in intensity we have to keep in mind that we interact with the electron beam in plasma. Here the electron beam is of $\sim\mathrm{\upmu m}$ size \cite{Weingartner2012_BUNCH}. If we assume a linear gradient across the profile from low intensity to high intensity, we require a variation in intensity of a factor of $\sim 4$ to cause an inversion as seen in Figure \ref{linICS:Figs:LaserWireExamples_IntensityMatch_Tilt}. Over the scale of few microns this seems very unlikely, particularly in the homogeneous near-field of the laser beam. In addition, the inversion has been observed consistently across shots with high and low yield signals being inverted but not consistently arranged (high top, low bottom for instance), such that an intensity variation in the beam profile does not appear to be consistent with the experimental results.
\vspace{\baselineskip}

The second hypothesis is that the electron beam is still evolving and that it inverts its spatial charge distribution over the remaining propagation within the plasma. The oscillation of electrons in this case are called betatron oscillations (see Section \ref{Appendix:Sec:Betatron}), with the betatron wavelength, $\lambda_\beta$, given by
\begin{equation}
\lambda_\beta = \lambda_p \sqrt{2\gamma},
\end{equation}
with the Lorentz factor, $\gamma$, and the plasma wavelength, $\lambda_p$ (see Section \ref{Chap:Theory:Sec:PlasmaFreq}):
\begin{equation}
\lambda_p [\mu m]= 2 \pi c \sqrt{\frac{\epsilon_0 m_e}{n_{e} e^2}} \approx 33.39 \times \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_{e}[10^{18} \mathrm{cm}^{-3}]}}\microns,
\end{equation}
where $\epsilon_0$ is the dielectric constant, $m_e$ the electron mass, $e$ the electron charge and $n_{e}$ the electron density of the plasma.
We can write in units useful for this experiment:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{\lambda_\beta [\mu m] \approx 2089\microns \times \sqrt{\frac{\epsilon [\mathrm{GeV}]}{n_{e} [10^{18} \mathrm{cm}^{-3}]}}.}
\end{equation}
For an electron density, $n_{e}$, of $(1.4\pm0.2)\times 10^{18}\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ the corresponding plasma wavelength is $28.22\pm2\,\mathrm{\upmu m}$, and the betatron wavelength for a $1\GeV$ electron amounts to $\lambda_\beta = 1765\pm124\microns$. The approximately remaining distance in the channel based on the shadowgraphy and the estimated beam size is $d\approx 1.1\mm$, with $\lambda_\beta > d>\lambda_\beta/2$, so that electrons would be able to cross to the other side of the main beam axis. However, most beams measured on this experiment have a large energy spread (see Section \ref{Chap:linICS:sec:Espec}) and would as a consequence also have a wide spread of betatron wavelengths as well. 

Since the radiation is emitted in the direction of the momentum vector of the electrons, we would expect a wide distribution of emission angles due to the oscillatory motion of the electrons. The emissions would then randomly inverted and non-inverted at different distances from the main beam axis. A consistent emission of radiation towards the main beam axis leading to an inversion of the gamma-ray signal throughout the shots would require a fixed betatron phase for the entire electron beam on every shot. In principle, shock injection is able to produce narrow-energy spread and hence narrow-phase beams, but since the accelerator in this experiment frequently generates spectrally long bunches with multiple visible oscillations, extended injection events must have occurred and a wide range of betatron phases will be present at all times. Note again that the electron beam itself has a wide energy spread and as a result different betatron wavelengths across the beam. In addition, considering potentially varying shock positions, a fixed betatron phase on a shot-to-shot basis seems very unlikely. In conclusion, this hypothesis is also not consistent with the experimental results.
\vspace{\baselineskip}

Finally, the consistency of the inversion could also be caused by an evolution of the wakefield bubble at a fixed position in the accelerator, for instance due to a density modulation in the gas target. The interferometrically measured density profile\footnote{The interferometry data was analysed by Cary Colgan (Imperial College).} is shown in Figure \ref{linICS:Figs:DensityJet} (left), where the wakefield driver beam propagates from left to right through the plasma. The density profile shows a density spike at the beginning of the channel (left) but also at the end (right). The first density perturbation is induced intentionally by a steel blade and causes the injection event, whereas the second peak is also present without the blade. The two density perturbations are also clearly visible in Figure  \ref{linICS:Figs:DensityJet} (right), which shows the recombination light of the plasma channel, where two distinct brighter plasma filaments indicate a locally increased plasma density. 

In this dataset, the laser pulse crosses the gas jet at $\sim 14\mm$ height above the edge of the nozzle to avoid damage from the second divergent scattering beam. This is uncharacteristically high above the nozzle as the density profile is typically optimised for an operation at few millimetres height \cite{Semushin2001_GASJETS}, such that the second density spike might be caused by an imperfect design of the nozzle for operation at that height.

A ramp-up in density is associated to an increase in the focusing force the electrons experience in the bubble \cite{Kostyukov2004_BUBBLEFIELDS}. 
The increasing field strengths will force the electrons back to the centre of the bubble such that their momentum vectors point towards the axis. Density up-ramps have been proposed for rephasing \cite{Guillaume_REPHASING} and focusing of electron beams \cite{Kuschel2016_PassiveLens}. If the interaction occurs before the electrons pass through the beam axis, the interaction would produce an inverted gamma signal and a fixed `returning' betatron phase due to the focusing of the fields. As the density profile is expected to remain roughly the same from shot-to-shot, the bubble evolution is expected to occur similarly at a fixed relative timing, making this the most robust and likely hypothesis to explain inversion of the gamma ray beam relative to the electron bunch.

A more extensive study and in particular a systematic scan in timing and position of the interaction plane would help to understand this behaviour better.
At the same time this indicates an interesting application of inverse Compton scattering to diagnose the electron beam dynamic \textit{in the plasma} at the end of the accelerator. Assuming the laser beam does not perturb the plasma significantly and both lasers arrive within a sufficiently small time window, scans in time could be used to investigate the orientation of the momentum vectors in the bubble as it approaches the end of the accelerator and to determine when and how the final momentum distribution, which is measured with the magnetic spectrometer, is frozen into the beam. 

On the other hand, this analysis further re-affirms the hypothesis that the beam properties change throughout its propagation through the remaining plasma. In order to reflect the parameters of the final electron beam the interaction has to occur outside the plasma when the beam has fully evolved.

\section{Conclusion}

In this Chapter, we presented experimental results from an all-optical colliding pulse setup. 
We successfully collided relativistic electron beams from a laser wakefield accelerator of up to $1.3\GeV$ energy, injected by a density modulation, with a second laser pulse of intensities between $a_0\sim0.2-1.0$. 
The laser-electron interaction consistently produced collimated gamma-ray beams from linear inverse Compton scattering. 
Due to the variability of the electron beams produced in this setup, the spectral shape of the gamma radiation varied similarly ranging from narrow-band to broadband radiation of a few MeV to photon energies in excess of $30\MeV$. 
The radiation was used to diagnose the properties of the laser pulse and the electron beam.

In Section \ref{Chap:linICS:Sec:RasterScan}, it was demonstrated that by translating the laser beam relative to the fixed electron beam axis (raster scan or spatial correlation technique), we can infer the diameter of the laser pulse and, as a result, determine the plane of the interaction relative to the focus and the intensity of the laser pulse at the interaction.

In Section \ref{Chap:linICS:Sec:YieldBeamSize}, on the other hand, the radiation yield measured on the gamma profile diagnostic was used to infer the diameter and intensity of the laser pulse at the interaction in a single shot.  
Future measurements would be improved by performing interactions in vacuum instead of plasma and by including additional broadening effects in the modelling of the gamma spectra, in particular redshifting and higher harmonics when $a_0 \rightarrow 1$.

Both techniques promise to become useful diagnostics in radiation reaction studies that facilitate high-intensity interactions systematically by measuring the spatio-temporal synchronisation of the electron beam and the laser pulse, rather than fluctuations between two laser pulses that are characterised, for instance, using spectral interferometry.

In Section \ref{Chap:linICS:Sec:ICS_EbeamDiag}, we then discussed the application of linear inverse Compton scattering as single-shot non-invasive electron beam diagnostic. 
The radiation profile measured on the gamma profile screen resolved spatial features in the electron beam, for instance smaller off-axis beamlets, and was used to retrieve information on the spatial distribution of the beam in both transverse dimensions, including the dispersion axis that is spatially not resolved in the magnetic spectrometer. 
The divergences measured with the gamma profiler and the electron spectrometer were then used to infer the ellipticity of both, the gamma beam and the electron bunch.
This ability will be in particular useful in the context of intensity measurements in highly non-linear Compton scattering \cite{HarShemesh2012_INTENSITY,Yan2017_ICS,Blackburn2019_ModelIndependentLaser}. 

However, several discrepancies, e.g. a lack of correlation in the pointing of the electron bunch and the gamma beam, indicated that the electron beam was evolving between the interaction with the laser pulse and the end of the accelerator. 
This suggests that future measurements should interact the electron bunch and the laser pulse outside of the plasma, i.e. in vacuum, to make sure that the radiation properties reflect the properties of the final electron beam.
%However, it also implies that linear ICS can be applied to investigate the beam evolution and dynamic in the plasma at the end of the accelerator until it reaches its final properties.

In summary, we demonstrated that linear inverse Compton scattering can act as a useful \textit{non-invasive diagnostic of both laser and electron beam properties} in \textit{multi} and \textit{single-shot} techniques, and will be particularly crucial to facilitate and diagnose high-intensity electron-laser collisions and their statistical variations in future radiation reaction studies.
