\chapter{Hard betatron radiation from dual shock features at Astra Gemini}

\section{Motivation}

Betatron radiation as interesting source due to short pulse duration, brightness and broad bandwidth. Small source size makes it suitable for phase contrast imaging and warm dense matter studies to probe transitions in matter states. It can also be used for XANES studies.

Over the years a variety of handles have been found to manipulate the accelerating structure of a wakefield and use this to enhance radiation produced through the oscillation of trapped and accelerated electrons.

Enhancement through shaping of the wavefront and imapcting the pulse evolution (oscillation and trapping), density ramps, drifting (increase of oscillation radius), density structures bending the beam, tilted shocks....

This work presents another example where a combination of shock injection and tilted shock front and drift results in an enhancement and hardening of betatron radiation by using a double shock feature.

\section{Experimental Setup}

The following experiment was performed at the Astra Gemini laser facility in early 2019. This dataset only used one of the two laser arms available at Gemini.

The laser is focused with an f/40 off-axis parabola onto the edge of a 15 mm conical supersonic helium gas jet. The laser is linearly polarised in the horizontal plane. The pulse duration of the laser was measured to be XX NUMBER with an energy on target on average of XX NUMBER onto a focal spot of size XX. This results in an a0 of around XX NUMBER. A razor blade with motorised translation and rotation motion can be introduced into the gas flow to induce a shock. The gas flow is characterised by a transverse optical probe split off from the main beam ending in a shadowgraphy and a Mach-Zehnder interferometry. A DSLR camera is imaging the recombination light of the plasma channel from the side and another camera, also used for aligning the gas target and the razor blade, is imaging the channel from the top. For this dataset the tip of the blade was driven in from the side the laser was propagating into the plasma up to around XX MM into the gas jet.

Relativistic electrons accelerated through LWFA and radiation produced travel further downstream through a XX NUMBER sized hole in another off-axis parabola at 300 mm distance that is used in another dataset as part of a colliding pusle experiment. The laser and electron beam are centred onto the hole and do not interact with the optics. It presents, hwoever, an aperture to high divergence radiation beyond XX NUMBER DIVERGENCE.

The electrons are then being dispersed by a large aperture magnet with field strength XX TESLA in the horizontal plane. Electrons of energies up to 200 MeV hit the inside of the yoke. The fan of electrons leaves the vacuum chamber through a wide kevlar-kapton window and passes through a scintillating Biomax LANEX screen that covers the window from the outside up including the laser axis. Radiation signal on axis can then be used to obtain an on-shot axis reference. The electrons then propagate further in air and pass through another standard LANEX screen after about XX METER distance and are then being dumped into a combined plastic-lead wall.
The LANEX screens are imaged by Andor Neo cameras and the electron energies can be deduced by measuring the field strength and the distances of the magnet and screens carefully.

The radiation propagates approximately on laser axis and unperturbed through the magnet in the chamber. On laser-axis a beam block of 10-12 layers of standard kitchen aluminium foil is attached to the kevlar-kapton window. Hard X-rays continue to propagate through the aluminium beam block and the vacuum window, the LANEX screen that also covers the axis and then hit a 45x45 array of 1 mm x 1 mm x 10 mm scintillating caesium-iodide crystals that record the beam profile of the radiation burst. Harder radiation propagates another XX DISTANCE before hitting another array of caesium-idodide crystals (see Methods for dual axis spectrometer). The emission of caesium-iode crystals is imaged by Andor iXon cameras.

\section{Electron Spectra}

The shape of the electron spectra vary from shot to shot but are mainly high charge beams up to 1.2 GeV. Large oscillations become apparent in some cases whereas in some cases the main oscillation clearly happens in the magnet dispersion direction which is also the laser polarisation axis of the driving laser beam.

\section{Background treatment}

In contrast to the previous chapters, the signal is comparatively low as there is less energy in the beam and less flux. Due to the divergent nature of the radiation the signal is spread out over the detector and is not constraint to a fine but bright line. On top of that the electron beams as discussed above show high charge and hence produce a lot of background signal. This makes the extraction of an accurate X-ray or gamma energy estimate challenging. We have to treat the data for an energy dependent bremsstrahlung background. In the ideal case this is being done on an individual crystal basis. Not doing this would result in a clear overestimate and skewing of the assumption. Hundreds of keV radiation from betatron radiation or suddenly tens of MeV indicate very different physics and need to be addressed differently.

\section{Estimating the spectrum}

\section{Enhancement of betatron radiation: theories}

From the electron energy spectrum the expected radiation would be of order 30 keV (critical energy) for a betatron radius of ...
To achieve a hardening of a factor of 10 the radius has to be increased by that same factor. The density crunch could be squeezing the electrons together giving them a strong transversal component due to the strong focusing fields reaching higher levels.
The tilted density scheme as described in other work would lead to a motion in the vertical direction (judging from the shadowgraphy images) hence enhancing oscillations preferentially in that axis. In some instances a strong preference in the polarisation direction is indicated which means a laser evolution and hence bubble evolution enhances existing oscillations instead of forcing a new one.
