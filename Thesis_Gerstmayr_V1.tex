\chapter*{Abstract}

The report is submitted to partially satisfy the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (PhD). It begins with an overview and summary of experimental methods and theory relevant to the author's research, followed by an analysis of experimental data taken during the course of this degree.

The main focus of this thesis is using relativistic particles accelerated by laser wakefield acceleration and highly energetic radiation to probe high-field QED phenomena.

The first results presented are based on two colliding pulse experiment performed using the dual 300 TW Astra Gemini laser facility at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, where GeV scale electrons were collided with a high intensity laser beam to search for signatures of a fundamental process called radiation reaction.
Experimental evidence strongly indicates that the electron bunch and the laser beam were successfully overlapped in time and space at the collision point. Furthermore, results suggest that this happened at high laser intensities ($a_0 \sim 7$) and electron energies ($\sim 600\, \mathrm{MeV}$), generating radiation from inverse Compton scattering at photon energies of several tens of MeV, which is significantly higher than reported in previous experiments \cite{Sarri2014,Chen2013a,TaPhuoc2012a,Khrennikov2015}.

The second chapter of results will be focused on an improved colliding pulse experiment, build upon the lessons learnt on the campaigns described in the first part, attempting a precision measurement of radiation reaction. 

The third chapter shines light at another campaign performed at the Astra Gemini laser facility, this time attempting to generate matter from light through the simplest QED mechanism there is: the linear Breit-Wheeler process.

\chapter*{Role of the Author}

The success of experimental campaigns is not the result of the work of one individual, but is enabled by the contributions of many.

The author has mainly been involved at experimental campaigns at the Astra Gemini laser facility at the Central Laser Facility (CLF), Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL), Oxfordshire, UK. At the submission of this thesis, the author took part in a variety of campaigns in different roles, ranging from initially focusing on setting up individual diagnostics to later on taking the experimental lead as Target Area Operator and finally, designing an experiment and coordinating the planning and preparation phase before taking again the experimental lead for the execution. This final project involved on the academic side coordinating the joint efforts of a collaboration spanning 8 institutions in 5 countries, including experimentalists and theorists. On the facility (CLF) side the communication with link and laser scientists, engineers and support staff to ensure  a frictionless execution of the experiment in terms of materials, logistics and accommodation.

The results presented in chapter 4 are based on data taken on an experimental campaign at Astra Gemini in 2015, during the first year of the author's PhD, investigating radiation reaction in the collision of a highly relativistic electron beam with a very intense laser pulse. During the campaign the author helped setting up different diagnostics, but was mainly in charge of the electron spectrometer. Following the completion of the campaign the author analysed the electron spectra, their energy, shape and statistical stability. The author also processed data from a diagnostic measuring the gamma-ray spectrum and investigated correlations between the gamma-ray signal and electron spectra. This analysis was a crucial contribution to identify successful collisions of the electron beam and the laser pulse, and express statistical confidence in those results. The findings of this campaign were published in Cole et al., PRX 8 (2018), with the author of this thesis as third author. In this context another experiment with a similar aim was performed at the Astra Gemini facility. The results were published in Poder et al., PRX 8 (2018), with the author of this thesis as co-author.

In chapter 5, the author presents results from an experimental campaign performed at the Astra Gemini laser facility aimed at performing a precision measurement of radiation reaction, distinguishing different models of this process. The author was leading the planning efforts of this experiment over the course of several months and also took the lead of the experimental execution in early 2019 as Target Area Operator (TAO).

In chapter 6, the author presents results from an experimental campaign on the measurement of the linear Breit-Wheeler process. The author was strongly involved in the planning of this experiment and acted as Target Area Operator (TAO) for the time of the experiment.
