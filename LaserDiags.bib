abstract = {We demonstrate the technique of self-induced plasma shuttering as a means of suppressing prepulse energy that accompanies high-energy, ultrashort laser pulses. This technique makes possible the generation of clean, high-intensity subpicosecond laser pulses even in the presence of high levels of amplified spontaneous emission from the laser system. Low prepulse energy is important in applications such as the generation of solid-density subpicosecond plasmas.},

abstract = {Temporal overlapping of ultra-short and focussed laser pulses is a particularly challenging task, as this timescale lies orders of magnitude below the typical range of fast electronic devices. Here we present an optical technique that allows for the measurement of the temporal delay between two focussed and ultra-short laser pulses. This method is virtually applicable to any focussing geometry and relative intensity of the two lasers. Experimental implementation of this technique provides excellent quantitative agreement with theoretical expectations. The proposed technique will prove highly beneficial for high-power multiple-beam laser experiments.},
