Developing a better understanding of the fundamental principles of nature lies at the very core of science. 
Ultrarelativistic particle accelerators represent powerful `microscopes', which provide invaluable insights into the fundamental building blocks of nature. Moreover, they have enabled many interdisciplinary applications, including ultra-bright FEL-based photon sources.

\textbf{Driving force for understanding is higher energy (smaller wavelength), now luminosity}


\section{High-intensity lasers}

\textbf{Driving force is intensity and short durations (for time resolution)}

Since the invention of the Nobel-prize awarded chirped-pulse amplification technique peak intensities of optical lasers have increased exponentially. This development has revolutionised our understanding of light-matter interactions and lead to disruptive transformations. They created entire novel scientific fields, such as strong-field atom and molecular science, attosecond physics, relativistic and nonlinear optics, and high energy density physics (HEDP).

\section{Particle accelerators and high-intensity lasers}

\textbf{Driving force will be energy and intensity}

Here some reasons why to do this kind of experiments with wakefield accelerators:
\begin{itemize}
\item Synchronisation of the laser pulse and the electron beam
\item high-intensity lasers are available
\item small beam size of the electron beam means all of the electron beam can be overlapped with a tightly focused laser pulse such that the electron is a real probe of the laser pulse (probe has to be smaller than what it probes).
\end{itemize}

The marriage of both technologies -- ultra-relativistic particle accelerators and ultra-intense lasers -- is bound to boost our understanding of nature once again, by providing access to electromagnetic fields which reach and potentially exceed those encountered in extreme astrophysical environments, e.g., close to the surface of a neutron star. The fundamental scale, at which qualitatively new physics is expected, is the so-called QED critical field. This scale defines the ``strong-field frontier'', which is complementary to the ``energy frontier'', that is traditionally explored with accelerators.

Approaching the atomic intensity of $\sim\!10^{16}\,\mathrm{W/cm^2}$ nonperturbative laser-atom interactions give rise to a wealth of strong-field phenomena, including tunnel ionization and recollision-induced high-harmonic generation (HHG) \cite{protopapas1997atomic,schafer1993above,freeman1987above,corkum1993plasma}. 
At the ``critical intensity'' $I_{cr}\!\sim\!10^{29}\,\mathrm{W/cm^2}$ the interaction with the vacuum itself becomes sizeable \cite{sauter1931verhalten,heisenberg1936folgerungen}, opening a qualitatively new regime of light-matter interactions \cite{schwinger1951gauge,DiPiazza2012_ICS}. 
By combining high-intensity lasers with ultra-relativistic electron beams, e.g., at SLAC's FACET-II \cite{hogan_preliminary_2016}, such extreme intensities become accessible in the electron rest frame due to the Lorentz boost of the intensity ($I' \sim 4\gamma^2 I$). 
In this so-called \textit{nonperturbative strong-field regime of QED} ($I'\!\gtrsim\!I_{cr}$) the recoil of emitted photons significantly perturbs electron/positron trajectories (strong-field radiation reaction) and prolific electron-positron pair production becomes substantial (vacuum breakdown). 

Such extreme conditions can be encountered in violent astrophysical phenomena like gamma ray bursts \cite{harding1991_GRB} and supernova explosions \cite{uzdensky2014plasma}, in the vicinity of pulsars and magnetars \cite{denisov_vacuum_2017,mignani_evidence_for_vacuum_birefingence_2017}, close to magnetized black holes \cite{blandford1977_KerrBlackHole}, and in the early universe \cite{Ruffini2010_PAIRSASTRO, Nikishov1962_PAIRSASTRO,kandus2011primordial,grasso2001_earlyUniverse}. 
Due to stringent luminosity requirements a future lepton collider (e.g., CLIC \cite{CLIC2012} or ILC \cite{ILC2013}) will reach the critical field strength at the interaction point \cite{Yokoya1992_SFQED_BeamBeam,Esberg2014_SFQED_BeamBeam}. 
Moreover, it might be beneficial to exceed this scale by orders of magnitude \cite{yakimenko2019prospect}, necessitating a better understanding of light and matter in extreme electromagnetic fields. 
At multi-petawatt laser facilities, which are currently being constructed in Europe \cite{Gales2018_ELINP,Weber2017_ELIBeamlines}, Asia \cite{Li2017_SULF,Shen2018_SULF} and the US \cite{Maksimchuk2019_ZEUS}, laser-plasma interactions will probe an interplay between strong-field quantum and collective effects. 
These facilities will open an exciting new research field within high-energy-density physics (HEDP) \cite{Grismayer2017_SeededQEDCascades,ridgers_dense_2012,nerush_laser_2011}.

\section{Thesis Outline}

This thesis puts its focus onto the versatile capabilities of laser wakefield accelerators and high-intensity lasers to generate different kinds of highly energetic radiation. It provides experimental examples spanning a range of photon energies from few to several hundreds of $\mathrm{MeV}$, and discusses their application in studies of fundamental phenomena of quantum electrodynamics (QED). 

First, theoretical concepts regarding XX (see Chapter \ref{Chap:Theory:SingleParticle}) and collective motion, in particular laser propagation and wakefield acceleration (Chapter \ref{Chap:Theory:LWFA}) are introduced, followed by a discussion of experimental methods underpinning this work (Chapter \ref{Chap:Methods}). The experimental results of this thesis are presented in Chapters \ref{Chap:linICS}, \ref{Chap:RR15} and \ref{Chap:BW}:

\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{4}
\item \textbf{Linear Inverse Compton Scattering and Beam Profile Diagnostic:}\\
Highly relativistic electrons from a wakefield accelerator were collided with a defocused laser pulse at $a_0 \sim 0.3$ generating sharply peaked gamma radiation from linear inverse Compton Scattering in the 10s $\mathrm{MeV}$ range. A novel gamma-spectrometer design that allows measuring the response of the detector from two sides was fielded for the first time. The application of linear ICS as non-invasive electron beam profile diagnostic is explored to measure divergence and pointing.
\item \textbf{Nonlinear Inverse Compton Scattering and Radiation Reaction:}\\
By scattering a tightly focused high-intensity laser pulse from a relativistic electron beam and generating gamma radiation from nonlinear Inverse Compton Scattering, it was possible to measure radiation reaction in an experiment. The energy loss of the electron beam and the spectrum of the radiation were used to pinpoint the interaction conditions and their agreement with theoretical models was tested. In particular, a statistical analysis of the electron beam fluctuations and its impact on the statistical significance of the results is presented.
\item \textbf{Bremsstrahlung source and the Linear Breit-Wheeler Process:}\\
An LWFA electron beam is passed through a solid target to produce bremsstrahlung with photon energies of 100s of MeV. The bremsstrahlung source is commissioned and optimised for yield and noise. The bremsstrahlung source is combined with a $\mathrm{keV}$ X-ray source in an attempt to measure the elusive linear Breit-Wheeler process. 
\end{enumerate}

Finally, the results are discussed and their impact for future research are evaluated. As outlook an experimental setup for future measurements of radiation reaction is presented, taking into considerations the findings and insights of the results presented previously.

%\item \textbf{Hard Betatron Radiation from dual shock features:}\\
%Electrons travelling in a wakefield transitioning through two density spikes experience an increase of transverse oscillations resulting in an enhancement of measured betatron radiation reaching hundreds of $\mathrm{keV}$. The dual shock structure was induced by introducing a blade into the supersonic gas flow of a helium gas jet and measured by a stack of scintillating crystals.
