abstract = {High-power lasers that fit into a university-scale laboratory can now reach focused intensities of more than 10(19) W cm(-2) at high repetition rates. Such lasers are capable of producing beams of energetic electrons, protons and gamma-rays. Relativistic electrons are generated through the breaking of large-amplitude relativistic plasma waves created in the wake of the laser pulse as it propagates through a plasma, or through a direct interaction between the laser field and the electrons in the plasma. However, the electron beams produced from previous laser-plasma experiments have a large energy spread, limiting their use for potential applications. Here we report high-resolution energy measurements of the electron beams produced from intense laser-plasma interactions, showing that--under particular plasma conditions--it is possible to generate beams of relativistic electrons with low divergence and a small energy spread (less than three per cent). The monoenergetic features were observed in the electron energy spectrum for plasma densities just above a threshold required for breaking of the plasma wave. These features were observed consistently in the electron spectrum, although the energy of the beam was observed to vary from shot to shot. If the issue of energy reproducibility can be addressed, it should be possible to generate ultrashort monoenergetic electron bunches of tunable energy, holding great promise for the future development of 'table-top' particle accelerators.},

@article{Faure2004_MONO,
abstract = {Particle accelerators are used in a wide variety of fields, ranging from medicine and biology to high-energy physics. The accelerating fields in conventional accelerators are limited to a few tens of MeV m(-1), owing to material breakdown at the walls of the structure. Thus, the production of energetic particle beams currently requires large-scale accelerators and expensive infrastructures. Laser-plasma accelerators have been proposed as a next generation of compact accelerators because of the huge electric fields they can sustain ({\textgreater}100 GeV m(-1)). However, it has been difficult to use them efficiently for applications because they have produced poor-quality particle beams with large energy spreads, owing to a randomization of electrons in phase space. Here we demonstrate that this randomization can be suppressed and that the quality of the electron beams can be dramatically enhanced. Within a length of 3 mm, the laser drives a plasma bubble that traps and accelerates plasma electrons. The resulting electron beam is extremely collimated and quasi-monoenergetic, with a high charge of 0.5 nC at 170 MeV.},

abstract = {Laser-driven accelerators, in which particles are accelerated by the electric field of a plasma wave (the wakefield) driven by an intense laser, have demonstrated accelerating electric fields of hundreds of GV m(-1) (refs 1-3). These fields are thousands of times greater than those achievable in conventional radio-frequency accelerators, spurring interest in laser accelerators as compact next-generation sources of energetic electrons and radiation. To date, however, acceleration distances have been severely limited by the lack of a controllable method for extending the propagation distance of the focused laser pulse. The ensuing short acceleration distance results in low-energy beams with 100 per cent electron energy spread, which limits potential applications. Here we demonstrate a laser accelerator that produces electron beams with an energy spread of a few per cent, low emittance and increased energy (more than 10(9) electrons above 80 MeV). Our technique involves the use of a preformed plasma density channel to guide a relativistically intense laser, resulting in a longer propagation distance. The results open the way for compact and tunable high-brightness sources of electrons and radiation.},

@article{Burza2013_SHOCK,
abstract = {A novel approach to implement and control electron injection into the accelerating phase of a laser wakefield accelerator is presented. It utilizes a wire, which is introduced into the flow of a supersonic gas jet creating shock waves and three regions of differing plasma electron density. If tailored appropriately, the laser plasma interaction takes place in three stages: Laser self-compression, electron injection, and acceleration in the second plasma wave period. Compared to self-injection by wave breaking of a nonlinear plasma wave in a constant density plasma, this scheme increases beam charge by up to 1 order of magnitude in the quasimonoenergetic regime. Electron acceleration in the second plasma wave period reduces electron beam divergence by {\%} 25{\%}, and the localized injection at the density downramps results in spectra with less than a few percent relative spread. Plasma-based laser-driven electron accelerators can produce strong longitudinal fields, {\$}100 GV=m, in the collective electron oscillations in the wake of an intense laser pulse [1]. This gives an advantage over conventional accelerators using rf cavities regarding the relatively compact high-power tabletop laser systems readily available [2]. In most experiments, injection of electrons into the accelerating structure relies on breaking of the plasma wave, which can thus self-inject electrons. This scheme is rather simple and quasimonoenergetic beams have been produced [3-5]. Electron beams of low spectral spread and divergence are necessary for these accelerators to be attractive for applications [6-8]. However, the wave breaking process is highly nonlinear, and in order to achieve higher quality beams, means to control the injection process are required. Both the amount of charge and the time of electron injection from the background plasma into the accelerating and focusing phase of the wakefield are crucial [9-11]. Here, self-injection [12-14] is inferior to most schemes with external injection control, such as colliding pulse techniques [15-18], ionization injection [19,20], or gradients in plasma electron density [21-24], which are used in this experiment. At the downwards gradient the plasma wavelength increases rapidly, the plasma wave breaks and electrons are trapped. Shock waves resulting in very abrupt density transitions have been produced previously with a knife edge introduced into a supersonic gas flow [25]. By this, a well-defined shock wave and a density downwards gradient is provided on the laser axis. Alternatively, an auxiliary pulse produced an electron depleted region by formation of an ionization channel followed by hydrody-namic expansion [26,27]. Our experiment relates to these, as plasma densities are modulated on the laser axis to control injection externally. We present a novel, staged, three step, laser wakefield accelerator that utilizes a thin wire crossing the supersonic flow of a gas jet. In this scheme, extremely sharp density transitions and shock waves facilitate gradient injection. These transitions may be of only some microns length [28]. In the first stage, comprised of a constant plasma density prior to reaching the first shock front, the pulse propagates and may thus match itself to the plasma conditions by relativistic self-focusing, self-modulation and temporal compression, with only a negligible amount of charge being trapped. After a variable length, adjustable by the wire position along the optical axis, the laser pulse reaches the second stage, where the first shock front, originating from the wire, in combination with the subsequent expansion fan produces gradients that enable injection. During the transition to the third stage, the plasma density increases from the density-diluted region right above the wire to the final constant density region. The plasma wavelength shrinks rapidly, which under certain circumstances enables a controlled charge transfer of the previously injected electrons from the first into the second plasma wave period. This mechanism, which is driven by inertia, may in addition have a filtering effect on the previously injected charges. The dominant process, however, is a new injection at the second shock front. The proceeding constant density plasma is finally utilized for electron acceleration driven by the already matched laser pulse.},

abstract = {Controlling the parameters of a laser plasma accelerated electron beam is a topic of intense research with a particular focus placed on controlling the injection phase of electrons into the accelerating structure from the background plasma. An essential prerequisite for high-quality beams is dark-current free acceleration (i.e., no electrons accelerated beyond those deliberately injected). We show that small-scale density ripples in the background plasma are sufficient to cause the uncontrolled (self-)injection of electrons. Such ripples can be as short as âŒ50 $\mu$m and can therefore not be resolved by standard interferometry. Background free injection with substantially improved beam characteristics (divergence and pointing) is demonstrated in a gas cell designed for a controlled gas flow. The results are supported by an analytical theory as well as 3D particle in cell simulations.},

The nanoparticles provide a very confined electric field that triggers localized electron injection where nonlinear plasma waves are excited but not sufficient for background electrons self-injection. We present a theoretical model to describe the conditions and properties of the electron injection in the presence of nanoparticles. Multi-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations demonstrate that the total charge of the injected electron beam can be controlled by the position, number, size, and density of the nanoparticles. The PIC simulation also indicates that a 5-GeV electron beam with an energy spread below 1{\%} can be obtained with a 0.5-PW laser pulse by using the nanoparticle-assisted laser wakefield acceleration.},

	abstract = {Ultrafast shadowgraphy is a new experimental technique that uses few-cycle laser pulses to image density gradients in a rapidly evolving plasma. It enables structures that move at speeds close to the speed of light, such as laser driven wakes, to be visualized. Here we study the process of shadowgraphic image formation during the propagation of a few cycle probe pulse transversely through a laser-driven wake using three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. In order to construct synthetic shadowgrams a near-field snapshot of the ultrashort probe pulse is analyzed by means of Fourier optics, taking into account the effect of a typical imaging setup. By comparing synthetic and experimental shadowgrams we show that the generation of synthetic data is crucial for the correct interpretation of experiments. Moreover, we study the dependence of synthetic shadowgrams on various parameters such as the imaging system aperture, the position of the object plane and the probe pulse delay, duration and wavelength. Finally, we show that time-dependent information from the interaction can be recovered from a single shot by using a broadband, chirped probe pulse and subsequent spectral filtering.}

These compact accelerators can produce high quality electron beams by using an intense laser pulse to drive a large electric field, but until now they have not achieved the stability and reproducibility needed in a practical accelerator. Now a new approach has succeeded in producing a compact and stable accelerator with the potential for use in applications such as radiotherapy and in radiography for materials science. The trick is to use an idea first suggested a decade ago but not previously mastered: a second laser pulse collides with the first to allow better control over the injection and subsequent acceleration of electrons.},

@inproceedings{Nakamura2007_GEVGUIDED,
abstract = {Laser wakefield accelerators can produce electric fields of order 10 – 100 GV ∕ m , suitable for acceleration of electrons to relativistic energies. The wakefields are excited by a relativistically intense laser pulse propagating through a plasma and have a phase velocity determined by the group velocity of the light pulse. Two important effects that can limit the acceleration distance and hence the net energy gain obtained by an electron are diffraction of the drive laser pulse and particle-wake dephasing. Diffraction of a focused ultrashort laser pulse can be overcome by using preformed plasma channels. The dephasing limit can be increased by operating at a lower plasma density, since this results in an increase in the laser group velocity. Here we present detailed results on the generation of GeV-class electron beams using an intense femtosecond laserbeam and a 3.3 cm long preformed discharge-based plasma channel [W. P. Leemans et al., Nature Physics2, 696 (2006)]. The use of a discharge-based waveguide permitted operation at an order of magnitude lower density and 15 times longer distance than in previous experiments that relied on laser preformed plasma channels. Laser pulses with peak power ranging from 10 – 40 TW were guided over more than 20 Rayleigh ranges and high quality electron beams with energy up to 1 GeV were obtained by channeling a 40 TW peak power laser pulse. The dependence of the electron beamcharacteristics on capillary properties,plasma density, and laser parameters are discussed.},

These electron rings had 170-280 MeV energies with 5{\%}-25{\%} energy spread and ∼10  pC of charge and were observed over a range of plasma densities and compositions. Three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations show that laser intensity enhancement in the wake leads to sheath splitting and the formation of a hollow toroidal pocket in the electron density around the wake behind the first wake period. If the laser propagates over a distance greater than the ideal dephasing length, some of the dephasing electrons in the second period can become trapped within the pocket and form an ultrarelativistic electron ring that propagates in free space over a meter-scale distance upon exiting the plasma. Such a structure acts as a relativistic potential well, which has applications for accelerating positively charged particles such as positrons.},

In case of energy measurements by means of a permanent-magnet electron spectrometer, the deviation angle can affect accuracy, especially for high energies. A two-screen single-shot electron spectrometer that correctly allows for variations of the angle of entry is considered. The spectrometer design enables enhancing accuracy of measuring narrow electron beams significantly as compared to a one-screen spectrometer with analogous magnetic field, size, and angular acceptance.},

@article{Pollock2011_MULTISTAGE,
abstract = {Laser wakefield acceleration of electrons holds great promise for producing ultracompact stages of GeV scale, high-quality electron beams for applications such as x-ray free electron lasers and high-energy colliders. Ultrahigh intensity laser pulses can be self-guided by relativistic plasma waves (the wake) over tens of vacuum diffraction lengths, to give {\textgreater}1 GeV energy in centimeter-scale low density plasmas using ionization-induced injection to inject charge into the wake even at low densities. By restricting electron injection to a distinct short region, the injector stage, energetic electron beams (of the order of 100 MeV) with a relatively large energy spread are generated. Some of these electrons are then further accelerated by a second, longer accelerator stage, which increases their energy to ∼0.5 GeV while reducing the relative energy spread to {\textless}5{\%} FWHM.},

@article{Lu2007_3DWAKE,
abstract = {The extraordinary ability of space-charge waves in plasmas to accelerate charged particles at gradients that are orders of magnitude greater than in current accelerators has been well documented. We develop a phenomenological framework for Laser WakeField Acceleration (LWFA) in the 3D nonlinear regime, in which the plasma electrons are expelled by the radiation pressure of a short pulse laser, leading to nearly complete blowout. Our theory provides a recipe for designing a LWFA for given laser and plasma parameters and estimates the number and the energy of the accelerated electrons whether self-injected or externally injected. These formulas apply for self-guided as well as externally guided pulses (e.g. by plasma channels). We demonstrate our results by presenting a sample Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulation of a 30f sec, 200T W laser interacting with a 0.75cm long plasma with density 1.5*10{\^{}}18 cm{\^{}}-3 to produce an ultra-short (10f s) mono-energetic bunch of self-injected electrons at 1.5 GeV with 0.3nC of charge. For future higher-energy accelerator applications we propose a parameter space, that is distinct from that described by Gordienko and Pukhov [Physics of Plasmas 12, 043109 (2005)] in that it involves lower densities and wider spot sizes while keeping the intensity relatively constant. We find that this helps increase the output electron beam energy while keeping the efficiency high.},
