@article{Tsai2018_shock,
abstract = {The injection physics in a shock-induced density down-ramp injector was characterized, demonstrat-ing precise control of a laser-plasma accelerator (LPA). Using a jet-blade assembly, experiments sys-tematically varied the shock injector profile, including shock angle, shock position, up-ramp width, and acceleration length. Our work demonstrates that beam energy, energy spread, and pointing can be controlled by adjusting these parameters. As a result, an electron beam that was highly tunable from 25 to 300 MeV with 8{\%} energy spread (DE FWHM /E), 1.5 mrad divergence, and 0.35 mrad point-ing fluctuation was produced. Particle-in-cell simulation characterized how variation in the shock angle and up-ramp width impacted the injection process. This highly controllable LPA represents a suitable, compact electron beam source for LPA applications such as Thomson sources and free-electron lasers. Published by AIP Publishing. https://},

@article{Burza2013_shock,
abstract = {A novel approach to implement and control electron injection into the accelerating phase of a laser wakefield accelerator is presented. It utilizes a wire, which is introduced into the flow of a supersonic gas jet creating shock waves and three regions of differing plasma electron density. If tailored appropriately, the laser plasma interaction takes place in three stages: Laser self-compression, electron injection, and acceleration in the second plasma wave period. Compared to self-injection by wave breaking of a nonlinear plasma wave in a constant density plasma, this scheme increases beam charge by up to 1 order of magnitude in the quasimonoenergetic regime. Electron acceleration in the second plasma wave period reduces electron beam divergence by {\%} 25{\%}, and the localized injection at the density downramps results in spectra with less than a few percent relative spread. Plasma-based laser-driven electron accelerators can produce strong longitudinal fields, {\$}100 GV=m, in the collective electron oscillations in the wake of an intense laser pulse [1]. This gives an advantage over conventional accelerators using rf cavities regarding the relatively compact high-power tabletop laser systems readily available [2]. In most experiments, injection of electrons into the accelerating structure relies on breaking of the plasma wave, which can thus self-inject electrons. This scheme is rather simple and quasimonoenergetic beams have been produced [3-5]. Electron beams of low spectral spread and divergence are necessary for these accelerators to be attractive for applications [6-8]. However, the wave breaking process is highly nonlinear, and in order to achieve higher quality beams, means to control the injection process are required. Both the amount of charge and the time of electron injection from the background plasma into the accelerating and focusing phase of the wakefield are crucial [9-11]. Here, self-injection [12-14] is inferior to most schemes with external injection control, such as colliding pulse techniques [15-18], ionization injection [19,20], or gradients in plasma electron density [21-24], which are used in this experiment. At the downwards gradient the plasma wavelength increases rapidly, the plasma wave breaks and electrons are trapped. Shock waves resulting in very abrupt density transitions have been produced previously with a knife edge introduced into a supersonic gas flow [25]. By this, a well-defined shock wave and a density downwards gradient is provided on the laser axis. Alternatively, an auxiliary pulse produced an electron depleted region by formation of an ionization channel followed by hydrody-namic expansion [26,27]. Our experiment relates to these, as plasma densities are modulated on the laser axis to control injection externally. We present a novel, staged, three step, laser wakefield accelerator that utilizes a thin wire crossing the supersonic flow of a gas jet. In this scheme, extremely sharp density transitions and shock waves facilitate gradient injection. These transitions may be of only some microns length [28]. In the first stage, comprised of a constant plasma density prior to reaching the first shock front, the pulse propagates and may thus match itself to the plasma conditions by relativistic self-focusing, self-modulation and temporal compression, with only a negligible amount of charge being trapped. After a variable length, adjustable by the wire position along the optical axis, the laser pulse reaches the second stage, where the first shock front, originating from the wire, in combination with the subsequent expansion fan produces gradients that enable injection. During the transition to the third stage, the plasma density increases from the density-diluted region right above the wire to the final constant density region. The plasma wavelength shrinks rapidly, which under certain circumstances enables a controlled charge transfer of the previously injected electrons from the first into the second plasma wave period. This mechanism, which is driven by inertia, may in addition have a filtering effect on the previously injected charges. The dominant process, however, is a new injection at the second shock front. The proceeding constant density plasma is finally utilized for electron acceleration driven by the already matched laser pulse.},
